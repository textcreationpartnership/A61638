            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:49488:3"/>a grateful acknowledgement. Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the diſpoſal of my nativity, calculated mee for your <hi>neighbour,</hi> by <hi>vicinity of place;</hi> and you have owned mee as a <hi>favourite,</hi> by your <hi>benigne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> For your <hi>Noble</hi> diſpoſition ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted mee as a <hi>Client,</hi> to your <hi>ſignal Favour, and ſingular Patronage,</hi> when the progging attempts of an <hi>ambitious Phylargyriſt,</hi> had well nigh made mee truly diſtreſſed. Had the bright rayes of your Lordſhips Bounty been onely terminated on myſelf, in that peculiar Patronizing of a cauſe, as juſt on one hand, as ſneakingly undermining on the other; nothing leſs than a Publick Reflection of gratitude, when ever oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offered it ſelf, would have been expected from your devoted Client. But your <hi>Goodneſs</hi> (being no waies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in its native and genuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of communicativeneſs) hath from its unalterable Centre derived moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous lines of pregnant Bounty, to ſome of my endeared relations alſo. To
<pb facs="tcp:49488:3"/>ſmother theſe favours then with a flat denial, would be an high impeachment of veracity; and not to acknowledge them on ſuch an occaſion, could plead for no distance, from down-right ſordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and plain ingratitude. This ſmall Treatiſe on theſe Conſiderations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates its ſelf at your Honours feet, not with any hopes to equallize your worth, or to merit your Patronage, with ſo ſlender an Eſſay as it is; but with a deſire to leave this Teſtimonial to the world, that your Favours have not been fruitleſly beſtowed on an ungrateful or unmindful ſervant. Yet if your piercing eye be but animated with a <hi>Candid Aſpect,</hi> ſo as to paſs by the faileurs and imperfections of the Author, the Theme it ſelf, and the main deſign of the Treatiſe, may without preſumption be deemed not unworthy the Patronage of the moſt Noble perſon in the world. Of the former I need not doubt, when I reflect on that clear reſemblance in your

Who now can think himſelf too great, or too good to patronize that, which alone hath the ſoveraign prerogative of conveying real goodneſs and virtue to thoſe that are ſo far bleſſed, as to be partakers of it. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> meeting <hi>Zenophon,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him to be a ſmart youth, holds up his ſtaff, bids him ſtand, and asks him where thoſe ſmall wares were ſold, that were ordinarily uſed, to which, when <hi>Zenophon</hi> gave him a ready anſwer, hee further asked him where men were made truly good: Alas Sir! ſaid hee,
<pb facs="tcp:49488:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>that I cannot tell: Follow mee then, ſaid <hi>Socrates,</hi> and thou ſhalt learn that of mee. Let thoſe that are ſo great ſtrangers to themſelves, as not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their own weakneſs, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the preſenting to the world a Syſteme of <hi>Socratical Wiſdome.</hi> All my ambition is by this ſlender Eſſay, to act the part of <hi>Socrates</hi> his ſtaff, to put thoſe to a ſtand, that are wiſe enough to be trading in the ſmall wares of the world, with a neglect of real goodneſs; and like a <hi>Mercurial Statue;</hi> to point out the way to the <hi>Preſence of God,</hi> which can make us both good and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, holy here, and happy hereafter. To be your Lordſhips Remembrancer in this, I humbly conceive it to be a peece rather of my bounden duty, than any bold or preſumptuous attempt: And that I need be no more, the world ſufficiently knows that is already fully acquainted with your conſtant zeal and forwardneſs to promote the flouriſhing of the Publick
<pb facs="tcp:49488:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Ordinances, where the <hi>ſpecial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God</hi> is to be enjoyed.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ere Hyeroglyphicks as uſual and intelligible with us, as formerly they have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> I ſhould have made no other Preface, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Reader, than by preſenting to him, the portraiture of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in the frontiſpeece of this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. For the main ſcope and deſign of my preſent undertaking, is to vindicate the Publick Worſhip of God, and his ſacred Ordinances, from that undervaluing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which hath been thrown upon them, by <hi>Quakers, Familists, Libertines, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Sectaries,</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> of all ſorts and ſixes. Now <hi>Charity,</hi> that makes mee look abroad, and take a view with an eye of pitty and tender commiſeration, of the diſtreſſed, and diſtracted eſtate, of Gods Vineyard planted among us: And mee thinks I hear her rounding mee in the ear with the words of Chriſt to his Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles, c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, that ſpoil the Vines: For our
<pb facs="tcp:49488:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>Vines have tender Grapes.</hi> Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, are the greater and the leſſer Foxes, and the hunting and taking of ſuch, is not only a noble recreation (adaequate indeed for the vaſt abilities of the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly ſpirited Chriſtians) but alſo a very charitable undertaking for the Church of God, in thoſe that can but any waies help forward ſo ſerviceable a deſign. For theſe, like Foxes, are both cunning, and cruel, and both waies they corrupt the Vines, deſtroy the Churches of Chriſt. As cunning as a Fox! Where could wee finde the Proverb more fully verified, than in the ſubtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding Schiſmaticks of our age? And for bloody cruelty, can we finde a parallel to theſe, where they get power? How have the tender Vines, nay the Vineyard of <hi>England,</hi> been corrupted, and deſtroyed of late by ſuch cunning, and cruel beaſts, as theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Foxes are? And is it not highly charitable to indeavour the reclaiming and reformation of thoſe, whoſe main intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to ruine the Church of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry the precious Truths and Ordinances of the Goſpel? <q>The Wolves were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of this Land by the wiſdome of a victorious Prince: Oh! that we could ſee the like deliverance from the Foxes.</q> Then,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49488:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>As for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that puts mee upon look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well about mee at home, ſince that in that little ſpot of ground Divine providence and goodneſs hath called mee to be reſident upon, in the work and calling of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, I found many, even too many of theſe little Foxes, to have their fixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, being ſadly perverted by the groſs and ſtrong deluſions of the <hi>Quakers.</hi> Theſe I finde to be ſuch, who have not only rejected the juſt Authority of the Church, and the lawful power of the Magiſtrate in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ordering of the external adjuncts of Religious Worſhip, but alſo, with as great indignity againſt God, as injury to their own ſouls, have utterly thrown off the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials and ſubſtantials of Goſpel Worſhip. Pride, ignorance, prejudices, errors, and groſs principles of Enthuſiaſm, have hurried them on to an high degree of contempt of Publick Prayers, Preaching, Sacraments, and the reſt of Gods ſacred ordinances. Theſe by right are part of my charge, though they have withdrawn themſelves from being any part of my flock. Not only <hi>Charity,</hi> but <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and equity, have put mee upon a deep reſentment, of that deſperate and forlorn condition, they have wilfully and obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plunged themſelves in, by giving up their
<pb facs="tcp:49488:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſouls to groſs and ſtrong deluſions. To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the beſt means, and to uſe the moſt likely waies and methods for their recovery, ſeems to mee not only truly charitable, but highly juſt and equitable: As being obliged, in imitation of my bleſſed Redeemer, to do my utmoſt by all lawful means, to re-gain the loſt ſheep, who have voluntarily ſtrayed from the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Private conference, which I have had with many, I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to found very ſucceſsleſs, harp and harrow agreeing as well, as the uſing of reaſons and arguments with abſurd and unreaſonable men. Preaching down their errors, though neceſſary to preſerve others right and ſound in the Faith, yet have I found it fruitleſs too, to the reclaiming of thoſe, whoſe grand errour is in an utter incapacity of being reached this way, it ſelf being a wilful ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from, and a proud contempt of the Publick Ordinances. I have ſometimes thought that prayers, tears, and pitty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch deſperately forlorn wretches, were the only means for reclaiming of them, or elſe they were for ever undone: Theſe I have thought muſt do the work, yet even theſe have I known, when proffered, and promiſed, to be notoriouſly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely rejected by one, who told mee hee
<pb facs="tcp:49488:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſtood not in need of the prayers of any. But will they, nill they, the benefit of my prayers, they muſt and ſhall have, till I have reaſon to beleeve, that God will have mee to pray no more for them; and how to be aſſured of that, I know not, but by being evidently aſſured, that they have ſinned the ſin unto death. But prayers, and the uſe of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means, are no waies inconſiſtent for the obtaining of any deſired bleſſing. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering therefore how induſtrious the little Foxes are in ſearching out their prey, how ſtudiouſly diligent ſeducers all along have been by continual prating in their canting language, and by publiſhing their unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible phancies, and all to purchaſe Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites to Hell, and to delude poor ſilly ſouls into the damnable paths of irrecoverable ruine, without rich mercy. Out of a deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of that dangerous and ruinous courſe, many, not only in my own Pariſh, but throughout the whole Nation, are ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into which took its riſe principally from the rejection of the Publick Worſhip, have I adventured the publication of this ſmall Treatiſe, as an antidote, through Gods bleſſing, againſt that corroding Canker, and ſpreading gangrene of heretical and diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical deluſions. If many poor ſouls thus
<pb facs="tcp:49488:10"/>groſly deceived, were but rationally convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that by leaving Gods publick inſtituted Worſhip, they did throw off Gods ſpecial preſence, and violently ruſh upon the Devils ground, I am apt to beleeve a little mature conſideration, would ſuddenly reduce them to their right wits, and then to the right waies of Gods Worſhip again. This have I made my preſent task, to convince ſouls of Gods ſpecial Preſence, in the places, and aſſemblies of publick inſtituted Worſhip of God. This truth, if once admitted with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſatisfaction to the mind, thoſe other errors and deluſions, which are taken up partly upon meer ignorance, partly through miſ-apprehenſions, and groſs prejudices, by a ſound and ſolid diſcovery of the mind of God in his Publick Ordinances, would ſoon vaniſh away, and dwindle into nothing. What remains, ſhall be only to implore an effectual bleſſing from Heaven, upon theſe weak endeavours of mine, That they may promote piety prevent apoſtaſie, raiſe thoſe that are fallen, confirm thoſe that ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the waies of God, and contribute ſomewhat or other to the furtherance of ſouls in their progreſs towards the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>

               <p>§. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ans rational Reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, if faithfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, would, with convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing evidence, ſecure him, both againſt <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion.</hi> The ſound acknowledgement of a Deity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49488:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>leads the mind to a <hi>Religious</hi> Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of him: For that comes ſhort of a truly Divine Being, and cannot rationally be owned as <hi>God,</hi> which when diſcovered, doth not forthwith preſent it ſelf to intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent creatures as the true object of their Religious <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and Sacred <hi>Adoration:</hi> Now Self-reflection may eaſily diſcover that there is a God, and this may ſerve to rout <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> And that ſame mind that is able thus to diſcover a Deity, doth alſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally prompt us to an acknowledgement of that undoubted homage which is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable right of the Supream Soveraign of the world, <hi>viz.</hi> Religious Worſhip, and Adoration: And this ſpeaks <hi>Religion</hi> to be highly rational, as that which is connatural to intelligent creatures, and withall brands <hi>Irreligion,</hi> with the greateſt unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the world. Let us a little conſider now what Self-reflection can do towards the diſcovery of a Deity. 'Tis evident that mans ſoul is not limited, and reſtrained onely to direct Acts in its operation, but it is uſually as able to reflect upon its own Actions, and take a review of them, as it is at the firſt, in a direct Act of knowledge, to apply its ſelf to any peculiar intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Object. As Scripture plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49488:14"/>a diſtinction 'twixt the direct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect Acts of Faith:<note place="margin">1 Joh 5.13</note> So the conſtant expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of a rational ſoul, evidences a clear diſtinction of the reflect Acts of knowledge, from thoſe that are direct. For the mind in its reflection, peculiarly fixes upon its own former Actions, as the proper object it converſes about: But as it exerts direct Acts of knowledge, its circumference is as large, as the latitude of Beings, or objects that are in themſelves intelligible. Suppoſe now a contemplative mind, ſetting it ſelf to take a true ſcantling of mans nature; it muſt needs abſtract the humane nature from all thoſe conditions, that would limit it to individual perſons; and it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as ſomewhat common to all men; here is a direct act of the mind: But when he reviews this Action, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſearches into the manner of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, and diſtinct underſtanding of the humane nature, and takes notice of the power, and <hi>ſpecies,</hi> by which the act of the mind was exerted; this is properly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. Now the mind by this may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive, that thoſe intellectual Images which repreſented the nature of man, as abſtracted from all material accidents, cannot be corporeal and material them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49488:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>but immaterial, and refined from the dreggs and droſs of matter. Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immaterial, do neceſſarily require a Spiritual Power, and Incorporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to reſide in, as their proper ſubject. Therefore it follows, the rational ſoul that thus reflects upon its ſelf, can be no other than an incorporeal, and immaterial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. If it further ſearches into the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of an immaterial ſubſtance, as the ſoul of man is concluded to be; it cannot but conclude, that it could not poſſibly be made of any pre-exiſtent matter, when in its own nature it is immaterial or ſpiritual. Beſides, the nobleneſs of its being, and the excellency of its operations, ſpeaks it to be of no mean, earthly, or ſublunary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. If the ſoul (being immaterial) cannot be generated, or made by any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial production; it remains, it muſt have its being immediately raiſed out of nothing, which (being a work of Omnipotency) will evidently demonſtrate the being of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and Omnipotent Agent, which firſt gave life, and being, to an immortal, and immaterial ſoul, which can be no other than <hi>God himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. Having thus diſcovered the Being of God, and that hee muſt be of an Infinite
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49488:15"/>Power, to create an incorporeal ſubſtance out of nothing; it were no difficult task, to demonſtrate the reſt of Gods Attributes, from this, that hee is Omnipotent, or of an Infinite Power. But to paſs by all other Attributes, I ſhall onely conſider the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Inference, of Gods Immenſity or Omnipreſence, from the preſuppoſed Being of his Infinite Power. For a <hi>Being</hi> or Agent of Infinite <hi>Power,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be of an Infinite <hi>Eſſence;</hi> becauſe otherwiſe the principle of operation would tranſcend the nature of the Eſſence and Being; and a Finite Eſſence would abſolutely and ſimply be inveſted with an Infinite Power; which is as repugnant to right reaſon, as deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the nature of the Supreme <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>Beings, God bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> If the Eſſence be infinite, that is, of Infinite Power, it follows, that <hi>that</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence cannot be limited, or reſtrained to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny finite ſpace: For that which is any waies limited, cannot every waies, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely be Infinite. If an Infinite Eſſence be not limited by any finite ſpace; then this created Fabrick of the world (being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, becauſe created) cannot contain it within its bounds. But as it is every where preſent in the world, ſo being infinite, it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49488:16"/>muſt needs exceed the limits of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſo alſo the largeſt bounds of the higheſt Heavens: So that God which is Infinite, and illimited in his Eſſence, muſt neceſſarily be granted to be in that bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Imaginary ſpace, which muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed beyond the ſurface of the world. This may further be proved thus; either God can produce another creature, in that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſpace, or hee cannot: If hee cannot, then he would not be Infinite in his Power, which would be repugnant to his Being, and the contrary hath already been evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. If hee can, then hee would either be preſent with that creature, or not: If not, his Eſſence would not be Infinite, becauſe excluded from that ſpace, where the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſuppoſed to be. If hee be preſent, then either newly preſent with it, or he was eternally ſo: If newly, then there would be a real mutation in his Being, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent now, where hee was not before, which is as derogatory to Gods Infinite Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as a local reſtraint and limitation is to the Infiniteneſs of his Eſſence. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then, that hee was eternally preſent there, and if ſo, then hee alwaies was in that boundleſs Imaginary ſpace, where the creature was ſuppoſed to be produced,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49488:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>which was the matter to be proved.</p>
               <p>§ 3. That this Introduction thus indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly deſigned, may not to any one ſeem wholly unſuitable to the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, concerning the ſpecial Preſence of God: I would adviſe the Reader, ſeriouſly to weigh both the <hi>matter</hi> expreſſed, and the <hi>manner</hi> of its diſcovery; and hee ſhall finde both highly ſubſervient to my main deſign. The chief <hi>matter</hi> is Gods Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and his Immenſity, or Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Conſider theſe <hi>joyntly,</hi> ſo they are a ſolid foundation for that Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is due to God; for both Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and Omnipreſence, are neceſſarily required in the proper object of Religious Adoration, as is more fully ſhewn, c. 4. § 2.<note place="margin">C. 4. § 2.</note> And Gods Omnipreſence conſidered <hi>ſingly</hi> by its ſelf, and <hi>abſtractly</hi> from the other, is preſented as a neceſſary Caution, to leſs wary minds, to ſecure them from all thoſe unworthy thoughts, that may any waies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the Infiniteneſs of his Eſſence, when they ſhall ſee a diſcovery made of Gods ſpecial Preſence, in the places of his Publick Worſhip under the Goſpel. For Gods ſpecial manifeſtation of himſelf, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven, or in the Temple of old, or in his Church, and faithful Servants now a

               <p>§ 4. If wee do again conſider the <hi>manner</hi> of diſcovery of theſe two fore-mentioned Attributes, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is by the very light of nature, and by the improvement of right reaſon, and underſtanding (that common benefit, that Chriſt <hi>enlightens every one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that comes into the world.</hi>)<note place="margin">Joh. 1.9.

For, conſider this inward Light, in its <hi>ſpeculative</hi> part, wee ſee in ſome meaſure what uſeful diſcoveries it may accommodate us withall, by what hath been before mentioned. And look upon it again in its <hi>practical</hi> office, as it ſparkles in mans natural conſcience, ſo it may be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49488:17"/>very ſerviceable to the deſign of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when inward convictions of many groſs ſins, repugnant to the very dictates of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light, do render us reſtleſs in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, till wee have found a more ſpiritual conviction of ſin, by the Law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his Word, and a converſion from them unto God, through Chriſt, by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, according to the tenour of the New and Goſpel Covenant. But that this <hi>Inward Light,</hi> which the Wiſe man ſtiles <hi>the Candle of the Lord,</hi> and at the beſt,<note place="margin">Pro. 20.27</note> burns but in the ſocket of a corrupt mind, with very much dimneſs, ſhould ever diſcover the right and ready way to the New <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> is the product onely of mens fooliſh fancies, their pride, and ignorance. Would not from hence a ſtrong impeachment of the Divine Wiſdome be raiſed, that hee ſhould ſend Chriſt into the world, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſalvation for loſt, and fallen man, when by this inward Light, hee might have obtained it well enough before?</p>

Now wee living, and moving, and having our being <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> God, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that God is preſent with us, and every thing that either lives, moves, or hath a being.</p>
               <p>§ 6. But though God be every where preſent, and ſo with every creature equally,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49488:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>in regard of his <hi>Infinite Eſſence,</hi> and of his <hi>Immenſity:</hi> Yet as to the <hi>Specialty</hi> and <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Efficacy</hi> of his preſence, hee is not with all, either things, or places and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, after the ſame manner preſent. For it hath been obſerved, that the Scriptures do evidently ſet out, divers degrees of Gods ſpecial preſence. The <hi>firſt,</hi> and chiefeſt,<note place="margin">Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, 1 Of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> is with the humane nature of Chriſt, which God the Son, the ſecond perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, hath hypoſtatically united to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and really taken into the unity of his own perſon: Whence God is ſaid to be made man, <hi>the Word to be made fleſh.</hi>

And the higheſt, and moſt wonderful degree of Gods preſence, that ever was. A <hi>ſecond</hi> degree, and the loweſt,<note place="margin">2 Of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> is, that God is preſent with all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the preſerver, guider, and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them. A <hi>third</hi> degree is,<note place="margin">3 Of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> that God is preſent with the Glorified Saints and Angels in Heaven, whom hee doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uphold in their Being, but peculiarly vouchſafes to them the ſolace and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of never fading bliſs and happineſs.

Though Gods <hi>Right,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Dominion</hi> over the creatures, doth not ariſe from the higheſt benefits hee hath beſtowed on them, even that of their very Being by Creation, but from that ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Excellency of his own Being and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; yet having beſtowed a Being on them by his <hi>Power,</hi> hee counts himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in point of honour, to give them a neceſſary ſupport in their Being, by <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> and <hi>Providence.</hi> The whole World was made, as a Manſion-houſe for himſelf, and would not this be ready to ſink under its own ruines, and preſently creep again into the boſome of <hi>non</hi>-entity, if God ſhould withdraw his manutenency, and leave it to it ſelf, as it is created?

And as for ſincere Chriſtians, that have their ſenſes exerciſed in the things of God, that are neither bewitched under the power of ſin, nor beſotted with any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing errors, they dare boldly contradict it as prophane, and untrue. For their often experience can evidence to the world, the neerer they come to the Church and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, the neerer they come to God too: Becauſe there they are wont to have

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Cains</hi> ſad farewell to his beſt friends, in that <hi>firſt,</hi> hee leaves his Fathers Family: Having killed his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> hee bids farewell to his Father and Mother too: In killing his Brother, hee had ſtab'd all his comfort at home: Hee could expect nothing but frowns from them, whom his malice and madneſs had bereft of a tender Childe; this is implied. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Parents, hee ſhakes hands with, and ſhamefully leaves, his moſt abſolute and beſt friend too, even one that would be a friend indeed, <hi>when Father and Mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake one,</hi> viz.

               </p>
               <p>§ 2. But to give further light into the full meaning of the place, two queſtions are neceſſary to be reſolved.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>How is</hi> Cain <hi>ſaid to go forth out of Gods preſence?</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It cannot be meant of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of glory. The injoyment of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Glory, is a priviledge onely of the life to come, of which <hi>Cain,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the preſent ſtate hee was in, was uncapable of, hee being yet a Citizen of this world, and his ſoul confined to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of Clay. Beſides, what ſhould a murderer do in Gods glorious preſence, hee can never come there without repentance. For vileneſs and vanity, to obtain the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Viſion, is wholly impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not meant of Gods natural
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49488:27"/>and eſſential preſence.<note place="margin">Pſa. 139.7</note> 
                  <hi>Whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence?</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could <hi>Cain</hi> flee from God, who is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent? The <hi>Circle</hi> of an Infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath its <hi>Centre</hi> every where, and its <hi>Circumference</hi> no where, and there is no avoiding of his preſence. In vain ſhall the wicked call to the Hills to fall on them, and to the Mountains to cover them, when even there the wrath of an Omnipreſent, and ſin-revenging God, will finde them out, and ſeize upon them. How could God exert his Vindicative Juſtice, on rebellious Mortals, if they could either cunningly ſculk, or cowardly ſneak out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? As God is in Heaven by his Glory, ſo is hee in Hell by his Juſtice; yea every where by his Eſſence, where any of his Attributes have any operation. And it is as poſſible for a Creature to turn its ſelf abſolutely into nothing, as it is for it, to withdraw from the Omnipreſence of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the preſence of Gods Grace, wee muſt diſtinguiſh. For this is twofold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That whereby hee <hi>enlivens mens perſons,</hi> without which they remain dead in ſins. Thus is hee preſent alwaies with his Saints, this is not here meant. <hi>Cain</hi> never
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49488:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>went from this preſence, for hee never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it. Never any yet brought <hi>Cain</hi> as an inſtance, or example of falling from Grace, which would be very plain, if it were meant of this preſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That whereby hee <hi>enlivens his Ordinances;</hi> without which they are as an empty ſound, and a dead letter. God is ſingularly preſent, where hee is worſhipped, and his Ordinances enjoyed. Where two or three are gathered together, I will be there in the midſt of them. <hi>Cain</hi> forſook Gods preſence, when hee left the place of Gods Worſhip, and his Ordinances. ☜</p>

               </p>
               <p>Propoſ. 1. <hi>That God ought to be worſhipped, is eſſential to the Divine Nature.</hi> By <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49488:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the general, I mean the performance of reſpect unto any thing, or perſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eſtimation and dignity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In regard of its object, it may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip. Divine Worſhip, uſually is called <hi>Adoration,</hi> which is that whereby the mind yeelds due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and reſpect unto God, owning of him as the Supreme Soveraign of the world, and depending upon him, as the beſtower of all good, and preſerver from evil. Now this Adoration, or Religious Worſhip, is eſſential unto the Divine Nature; God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that in his moſt perfect Nature, which neceſſarily calls for it at the creatures hands. To avoid all miſtakes, take the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> thus, <hi>Adorability is proper onely unto God.</hi> This Adorability, or Inward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in God, in its formal notion, ſeems not to be placed in that Tranſcendent Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in that ſingular and independent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Eternal Deity, whereby God is infinitely above every creature; But it doth moſt ſpecially denote his <hi>Spiritual Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> over intellectual creatures; and thus God ought to be worſhipped by them <hi>in Spirit,</hi> as hee is the Father of Spirits. For,<note place="margin">John 4 24 Heb. 12.9</note> although Adorability be conceived to be in God from all Eternity, yet it cannot ſo
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49488:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>much as be imagined, or conceived by us, but as a relative and reſpective Attribute of God, which wee conceive of, in God, in order to the creatures, ſome Action of theirs interpoſing; ſo that in Gods <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Viſion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deus ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilis, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorans cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilis, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationis — actio poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilis.</note> wee muſt neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe three things to be together; <hi>God Adorable, One adoring Creable, and the Action of Adoration poſſible.</hi> Neither is God ſaid to be adorable, with a reſpect had to every creature indifferently: For there are but two created natures onely, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Men, and of Angels, in reference to which, God is ſaid to be adorable, and ought to be worſhipped by them.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Having thus briefly opened the terms of <hi>Worſhip, Adoration,</hi> and <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> I ſhall now prove the Propoſition by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either Spiritual Worſhip and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſſary, and naturally due unto God, and proper unto him alone, or elſe our Saviours weapon was but weak, that he uſed to repel, one of Satans principal temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. To undervalue the skill of Chriſt our Captain, in the managing of ſpiritual weapons, againſt the Devil, is both blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt God, and undermining of the Goſpel, and the greateſt injury to our own
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49488:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>Faith. But the very ſtrength and force of our Saviours anſwer to the Devil, is couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this. That <hi>Spiritual Adoration is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per onely unto God. It is written,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 4.10</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve. It is written</hi>] Our Saviour, to inſtruct us, uſes nothing but Scripture Arguments; And where is this written?<note place="margin">Deut. 6.13</note> In <hi>Deut eronomy</hi> wee finde it. But the words are thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, and ſerve him.</hi> Our Saviours Argument is never the worſe, nor the weaker, in that hee takes the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of the place, though hee doth not exactly tye himſelf to the words. <hi>To fear God,</hi> is a more general term, and includes <hi>Worſhip</hi> under it; and when our Saviour is to deal with Satan, that would have Worſhip given to him, hee deems it a ſolid way of reaſoning, to infer a particular from a general, and calls that Scripture that comes by a clear conſequence from it. <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God.</hi> And Further, our Saviour ſticks not to ſay, It is written, <hi>And him onely thou ſhalt ſerve.</hi> Though it be but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in that place of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spanhem. Dub. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang Par. <hi>3.</hi> D. <hi>65.</hi> p. <hi>292</hi>
                  </note> For indeed the very nature of the ſubject ſpoken of, implies a peculiar reference unto God <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi> Becauſe thoſe things (ſuch as worſhip
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49488:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>and fear) which are due unto God <hi>as God,</hi> are due onely unto God, with whom no creature can claim a partnerſhip, in Divine Adoration, without <hi>great Sacriledge,</hi> and none can be admitted to it without <hi>groſs Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If the neceſſary requiſites of the proper object of <hi>Adoration</hi> be onely in God, then Adorability is proper onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. For how can that be the object of Divine Worſhip, which is not qualified with thoſe properties, and attributes, that are neceſſary for its conſtitution, in ſuch a capacity? but in God alone are thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites found. Which are theſe three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friſt, Omniſcience,</hi> that hee that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, ſhould know all our wants, our ſighs and groans, and know the deepeſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the moſt retired thoughts of our hearts. As true Worſhip may inwardly be performed many times, by the ſecret thoughts of the mind; ſo it is neceſſary, that hee that is thus worſhipped, ſhould have a peircing and omniſcient eye, to have a clear, and full view of thoſe very thoughts. For otherwiſe hee may be worſhipped, and hee not know it: And then what ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort would it be for the moſt ſpiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, to ſerve him with their hearts, who,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49488:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>unleſs hee be omniſcient, would be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant whether they worſhipped him or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Omnipotency,</hi> that hee ſhould be able to help us in our wants, and give in a ſupply ſuitable to our greateſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and neceſſities. Why ſhould I worſhip one that is not able to help mee? or why ſhould I not worſhip and adore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe beſides God, if that were as able to ſupply my wants, and relieve mee in any kinde of miſery, as God is, who is Omnipotent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Omnipreſence,</hi> that hee ſhould every where hear our prayers, and anſwer our requeſts. This was one great peece of unreaſonableneſs in the worſhip of the Heathens, that they made choice of ſuch Gods to worſhip, which they themſelves acknowledged were confined to particular places, and ſo could not be preſent to help them under any ſudden emergency; and becauſe they wanted power, their worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers would remain helpleſs ſtill, though they were preſent in their very <hi>Temples,</hi> the places of their confinement. Now God, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Onely Being</hi> in the world, that is both Omniſcient, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and Omnipreſent, and therefore A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorability is proper onely to him.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:49488:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>§ 3. This <hi>Propoſition</hi> being thus proved, it may eaſily be improved, to convince the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of grievous Idolatry, in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thoſe things, with a Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which are not proper objects of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as <hi>Images, Saints,</hi> and the like. As alſo to condemn the <hi>Socinians,</hi> thoſe great <hi>Patrons of Reaſon,</hi> of their groſs abſurdity and unreaſonableneſs, in deveſting Chriſt of his Divinity, and yet of attributing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip and Adoration to him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee is held but a Creature. But I had rather prevent a miſtake and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage amongſt ordinary Chriſtians, than ſtand to confute thoſe, that are viſibly the Diſciples of Antichriſt, as the former; or thoſe that have really forfeited the very name of Chriſtians, as the Latter.</p>
               <p>The miſtake is this, when Chriſt our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, God and Man, is propounded in Scripture as the Object of our Religious Worſhip and Adoration; leſs wary minds, may be apt to terminate their Worſhip, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his humane nature. When, as 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the humane nature, and fleſh of Chriſt is not God, though it be the fleſh of God, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>God the Son,</hi> and perſonally united to him. But the perſonal union, of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Nature, in Chriſt the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49488:35"/>Mediator, doth neither deſtroy, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the proprieties of either, but leaves them entire as they are in themſelves. And Adorability is no leſs a propriety of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, than Omniſcience, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, Omnipreſence, and Eternity are. God therefore manifeſt in the fleſh, is to be worſhipped with a <hi>Religious</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but his fleſh ought not thus to be worſhipped. As the <hi>King</hi> may be <hi>civilly</hi> worſhipped, who wears a Crown, or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem upon his head, and bears a Scepter, the emblem of Majeſty in his hand, yet neither Crown, nor Diadem, nor Scepter, can be ſaid to be honoured with <hi>a civil wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> And the godly, are then ſaid to have worſhipped Chriſt, when they knew clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Divinity, that hee was God as well as Man. As the blinde man made whole, when Chriſt had told him hee was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> that cured him; Then <hi>hee ſaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 9.37, 38</note> 
                  <hi>Lord I beleeve, and hee worſhipped him.</hi> Thus thoſe that ſaw Chriſt walking upon the Sea, and quieting of it.<note place="margin">Mat. 14.33</note> 
                  <hi>Then they that were in the Ship came and worſhipped him, ſaying, of a truth thou art the Son of God.</hi> See alſo the example of <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 5.8. And the Women that ſought Chriſt in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.9. And the <hi>Apsſtles,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49488:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>that were gathered together in the Mount when Chriſt took his leave of them. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>When they ſaw him, they worſhipped him,</hi> whom they knew now, to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> by his reſurrection from the dead.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Before I paſs to the next <hi>Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> wee may here from this firſt learn a true account, why Heatheniſh Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers would never admit the Worſhip of the <hi>True God of Iſrael,</hi> under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, or of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> revealed under the New Teſtament diſpenſation, but would willingly entertain the Worſhip of all other <hi>Gods</hi> whatſoever. One would have thought, the <hi>True God,</hi> who truly is the proper object of Adoration, might as well have been entertained, as any of the falſe, and fained <hi>Deities.</hi> The reaſon was this, becauſe it was very indifferent to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> after what manner hee was worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, ſo hee was but worſhipped at all, hee could eaſily admit a multiplicity of Gods. But <hi>The God of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when they are worſhipped, they muſt be worſhipped <hi>alone, they, and none other,</hi> all elſe muſt be excluded, it being the firſt and chiefeſt of all Gods Commands, Thou ſhalt not have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>any other Gods before my face.</hi> But the Worſhip

                  <note place="margin">Loco ſupra citato.</note> the Angels being not genuine parts of the Church, for which Chriſt dyed, and to which the Scriptures were given. 'Tis no wonder at all why the Scriptures have ſo deep a ſilence, of the manner and circumſtances, of the Angels worſhipping, and adoring of God. And 'tis but a <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ignorance</hi> for us to ſit down ſatisfied, and contented, without the knowledge of that, which God thought unneceſſary, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Scripture. How the Angels then
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49488:38"/>do worſhip God, wee need not much trouble our ſelves to inquire after, ſince wee have not evident manifeſtations of it in the Written Word. But this ſeems to be clear, they are not tyed to any <hi>time,</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, becauſe their very nature is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by <hi>aviternity,</hi> and not by time. And being of a pure Spiritual Nature, they have neither thoſe <hi>avocations</hi> by any particular calling, nor <hi>neceſſary diverſions</hi> from Gods Immediate Worſhip, as Man, if hee had continued innocent, muſt have had, for the very ſuſtaining of his life, and being, which would have been by ſeaſonable food. (The fruits in the Garden of Paradiſe being a ſufficient evidence, that God intended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent immortality to have been ſupported by ordinary means.) It is probable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they have no <hi>ſet times,</hi> but continue conſtant in the Immediate Worſhip of God, unleſs when God imploys them, as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as his <hi>Ministring Spirits,</hi> for the ſervice of his Church. And perhaps, even then their imployment, ſpeaks them onely <hi>diſtant</hi> from the other Angels, their fellow-worſhippers, and <hi>not abſent</hi> from the real worſhip, and ſervice of God. And thus it appears, they are not tyed to any <hi>place</hi> neither, as they are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49488:38"/>not to any <hi>limited time</hi> of Worſhip. For they being <hi>Spirits,</hi> are uncapable of any <hi>local circumſcription.</hi> And to enquire any further, may run us upon the Rocks of bold, and unſafe, and unwarrantable conjectures, in thoſe matters, the knowledge of which wee may very well ſpare, without the leaſt prejudice of our preſent comfort, or future ſalvation.</p>
               <p>§ 7. Propoſ. 4. <hi>The Sons of Men, which are of a mixt nature, partly Spirit, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Body, are by their very Beings determined both to time and place, in their rendring Actual Worſhip unto God.</hi> For man to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, is immediately conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Being, as a rational creature; and for man to worſhip God in ſome <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> is neceſſarily involved, in the very Worſhip it ſelf, that man is obliged to give unto God. And the very ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that do evince a neceſſity of Worſhip, to be given unto God by Creatures, that are <hi>partly Body,</hi> and <hi>partly Spirit;</hi> will infer a neceſſity of making <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> the inſeparable adjuncts of that Worſhip: So that theſe two, <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as appertaining to Divine Worſhip, are not to be eſteemed therefore <hi>good,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath <hi>appointed</hi> them; but God
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49488:39"/>hath therefore <hi>appointed</hi> them, and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> them, becauſe they are <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good,</hi> that is, neceſſary to Divine Worſhip, that man muſt yeeld unto God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſome <hi>time</hi> is neceſſary for man to worſhip God in; is the clear dictate of natural light. For man being <hi>partly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> as well as <hi>Spirit,</hi> and being naturally obliged, to worſhip God with both, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as well as internal Worſhip, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily required of him. Now all Actions of man, eſpecially thoſe which are <hi>external,</hi> muſt of natural neceſſity, lay claim to ſome <hi>time,</hi> for the performance of them. Neither can man conveniently attend upon the Worſhip of God, unleſs ſome <hi>time</hi> be ſet apart, in the which hee may be freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intangled from his ordinary work, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Thus far, <hi>time,</hi> and the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God,</hi> ſeem to fall under one, and the ſame command. For as God in creating of the world, did concreate and make <hi>time</hi> together with the world: So alſo when God commands, and appoints, any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip to be performed, by any actions of men, hee doth withall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and appoint, that neceſſary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of <hi>ſome time,</hi> wherein they ſhould be diſpatched. And that man might not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49488:39"/>be left wholly undetermined, as to the <hi>time</hi> of Worſhip, in regard <hi>ſome time</hi> in general was neceſſary; and it being highly rational, that the diſpoſal of the <hi>time</hi> for Worſhip, ſhould be at the pleaſure of God, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Soveraign, and Creator of man, who made him an intelligent creature, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of worſhipping God: It hath pleaſed our Soveraign, and Creator, to ſet apart ſome <hi>portion</hi> of our <hi>time,</hi> for his Worſhip, and to indulge the reſt to us to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the neceſſity of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>§ 8. Thus God, taking a pattern from his own Creation, employing <hi>ſix daies</hi> in the production of the world, and reſting the <hi>ſeventh:</hi> Hee hath freely indulged <hi>ſix daies</hi> for common and ordinary work, and a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> hee ſet apart for his more ſolemn Worſhip, and Service. <hi>And God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.3</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe that in it hee had rested from all his work which God created and made.</hi> Gods ſanctifying of the day, was ſetting of it apart for an holy uſe, that is, deſigning it to his Publick Worſhip and Service. It is true, the word <hi>Sanctifie</hi> is variouſly uſed in Scriptures, but here it muſt be one of theſe two waies taken: Either</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49488:40"/>1. By <hi>infuſion</hi> of Holineſs, and Sanctity into it, as holy men are ſaid to be ſanctified; or elſe</p>
               <p n="2">2. By <hi>ſeparation</hi> of it, from common uſe, and dedication of it to holy uſe; as the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Altar,</hi> are ſaid to be ſanctified. The firſt cannot be meant here, becauſe the circumſtance of a ſeventh part of time, is not capable of being made holy, by the <hi>infuſion of Habitual Holineſs,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of onely intelligent creatures, men and Angels are; it muſt therefore be ſaid to be ſanctified, in regard of its <hi>ſeparation from common uſe,</hi> and dedication to holy uſe, as the <hi>Temple</hi> was, which had no inherent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Being thus dedicated for an holy uſe, it muſt be either for Gods uſe, or mans; that is, that either God ſhould keep this <hi>holy day,</hi> or that man might obſerve it, as an <hi>holy day</hi> unto God. The diſhonour, that the obſervation of ſuch an <hi>holy day,</hi> would bring upon <hi>God,</hi> muſt needs by aſſe us to beleeve, that it was dedicated, and conſecrated for <hi>mans</hi> uſe, for him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it as <hi>holy</hi> unto God. This day is therefore ſaid to be ſanctified of God, that man might ſanctifie it, and dedicate it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. And hence it follows, that as man could never have lawfully dedicated
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49488:40"/>
                  <hi>it</hi> unto God, without a fore-going inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God; ſo the inſtitution of God, implies a known command given by God unto man. So that if any deſire to know where God commanded the obſervation of the Sabbath, before <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, they may ſee it here neceſſarily implied in Gods ſanctifying of it. And that God, doth here declare his mind by <hi>Moſes,</hi> by way of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſis,</hi> and <hi>Anticipation,</hi> concerning the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Sabbath, becauſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, to ſanctifie it two thouſand five hundred years after: Is but a meer ſhifting evaſion of prejudiced minds, the vanity of which hath been ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, by many worthy and learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. Onely this may ſuffice to evidence, that God himſelf hath interpoſed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of a <hi>portion of time</hi> for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in that hee hath ſet apart a <hi>ſeventh part</hi> of mans <hi>time</hi> for his Worſhip. And herein we may obſerve Gods infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and condiſcention of love. If God had asked man, how much time hee would willingly allow, for the worſhip of his Maker, who had given him his Being, and furniſhed the world with neceſſaries for the uſe of man: Hee could not for ſhame, have denyed God the one half of his time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49488:41"/>his frame, and making, that hee is <hi>half Spirit, when as the holy Angels,</hi> which are <hi>wholly ſpiritual</hi> in their Beings, are continually employed in Gods Worſhip, and Service; and yet wee ſee God requires but a <hi>ſeventh part</hi> of our time: They then muſt needs act very diſ-ingenuouſly, not to ſay, highly diſhonourably againſt God, who would rob God of this too.<note place="margin">

               <p>§ 9. 2. That ſome <hi>place</hi> alſo is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for man to worſhip God in, is evident by the very light of Nature. For every <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> ſuch as man hath, muſt by the natural neceſſity of its Being, be contained in ſome real place in the world; and indeed, <hi>to be in a place,</hi> is ſo proper to a <hi>Body,</hi> that wee may as well ſuppoſe it not to have a Being, as not to admit of a local circumſcription. If a <hi>Body</hi> cannot <hi>be,</hi> or <hi>exiſt,</hi> then neither can it <hi>operate,</hi> or perform any <hi>action,</hi> unleſs it be in ſome place; now therefore, the Worſhip of God being an external action, when publickly performed with others; it not onely requires <hi>a place,</hi> but neceſſarily requires <hi>a place capacious</hi> of many that muſt joyn in the ſame Worſhip: Becauſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip ſpeaks a joynt concurrence of ſeveral Worſhippers, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſame action of Religious Worſhip: So that the very light of Nature gives its clear ſuffrage, for the neceſſity of convenient places of meeting, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Publick Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. Is it not a ſhame now, not to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49488:42"/>live cloſely up to ſuch clear dictates of the <hi>Light within?</hi> muſt the convenient places of Publick meeting for Gods Worſhip be forſaken, becauſe the neceſſity of them is thus evident and apparent by <hi>Natural Light?</hi> is not this to cry up <hi>inward Light,</hi> and yet plainly to live in <hi>Darkneſſe,</hi> volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily cloſing their eyes againſt the ſparkling beams of it? And if popular conſent, and the Chriſtian Magiſtrates Civil Sanction, have interpoſed, in the deſignation of ſuch places; ſeparating them from common, and dedicating them to a Religious uſe; and if prevailing Cuſtome hath ſtiled the meeting places CHURCHES, probably according to the languag of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.18.20, 22. &amp; 34. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.

But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>§ 10. Propoſ. 5. <hi>God by his inſtituted Law did particularize and ſet apart ſome
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49488:42"/>places for his Worſhip and Service.</hi> The Old-Teſtament gives many inſtances of places ſeparated to Gods Worſhip. <hi>Paradiſe</hi> it ſelf was a place deſigned, wherein innocent <hi>Adam</hi> was not onely appointed, <hi>Terram,</hi> but alſo <hi>Deum colere,</hi> to worſhip and ſerve God <hi>in,</hi> as well as to till the ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

The Church of God was after that continued among the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> who had alſo their particular places for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service of God. But where the condition of the Worſhippers was ſo flitting and inconſtant, as that of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> was, wee cannot expect to finde, any <hi>ſet</hi> and <hi>ſolemn,</hi> but onely <hi>occaſional</hi> places, ſet apart for the Worſhip of God. But after the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Religious Worſhip, were more punctually determined, and appointed by God himſelf. Now thoſe places which ſerved for the Worſhip of God, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places <hi>commanded</hi> by God, or <hi>approved</hi> by him. Places commanded, as the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> and <hi>Temple;</hi> places approved by God, were their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and <hi>places of prayer.</hi>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49488:43"/>Tables of the Covenant, were laid up there in the Ark. Now the reaſon why God fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jewiſh Worſhip at the firſt, to the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> onely, was this, becauſe all men by reaſon of ſin, being ſtrangers to God, can no waies become righteous and acceptable unto God, but by the Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus, God and Man, the Eternal Son of God. It is Chriſt alone, that by virtue of his offering himſelf up as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God for us; at a certain fixed place, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> hath reconciled finful man to an offended God: It is hee that hath made God a Propitious Father to us, and by his interceſſion makes all our Prayers, Service, and Worſhip, that wee offer up unto God, to be acceptable unto him. Of this thing the Lord made the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> with its appurtenances, to be a clear type; and therefore commanded all that Legal and Ceremonial Worſhip, with which hee was ſerved by the Jews, to be performed no where elſe, but on the <hi>Altar,</hi> and before the <hi>Ark</hi> and the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle;</hi> by the which hee would clearly teach us, that neither our perſons, nor perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, nor any of our Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, would ever be acceptable to him, unleſs it be in and through Chriſt, who was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49488:44"/>ſhadowed out by thoſe Types, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. And again, the reaſon why the <hi>Tabernacle, Ark,</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> were fixed in no certain place, but moved to and fro, and variouſly placed up and down, in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which God gave to his People, was this; Becauſe Chriſt, who was ſhadowed out by thoſe Types, was to come to that People in the fleſh, and was to live and converſe among them, having no fixed habitation in the Earth, but occaſionally go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro, travelling up and down through that Land, doing the Will of his heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>§ 12. 2. God commanded the <hi>Temple</hi> to be built for his Worſhip and Service: The choice of the <hi>Temple</hi> for the place of his Worſhip, was not ſo much for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it was for his People; <hi>For the Lord dwelleth not in houſes made with hands.</hi>

               <p>§ 13. 3. Places for Worſhip among the Jews, which were not <hi>commanded,</hi> but <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi> by God, were <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeucha's,</hi> or places of Prayer. Though the Jews were to have but one Altar, or place
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49488:45"/>of Sacrifice, that namely, which the Lord ſhould chuſe, to place the Ark of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant there, the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> or <hi>Temple,</hi> yet had they other places for Devotion, and Religious uſe. As for the <hi>places of Prayer,</hi> if different from the Synagogues, as very many learned men think; their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference lay in theſe two things chiefly, that the <hi>Proſeucha's</hi> were a plot of ground en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed, with a wall, or any other enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, like to our Courts, and open above. But the <hi>Synagogues</hi> were covered buildings, like our houſes and Churches. Again, they differed as to the Service that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in them: In the <hi>Proſeucha</hi> they prayed onely ordinarily; in their <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> they prayed and interpreted the Scriptures; then in the <hi>Temple</hi> they both prayed, interpreted the Scriptures, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed. To theſe a third may be added, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 16.13 Act. 15.21</note> That the <hi>place of Prayer</hi> was without the City; but the <hi>Synagogues</hi> were within the Cities. <hi>But Moſes of Old time hath in every City, them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath-day.</hi>

Now theſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles or tokens of Gods ſpecial Preſence were many and various.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49488:51"/>then thoſe are the places of Gods ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Preſence: The reaſon of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is clear, becauſe the very formality of Gods ſpecial Preſence, is often ſet out in Scripture, by his Train and Retinue of Angels. Two things here are to be made good.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Preſence of God is ſet out by his Retinue of Angels.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Train and Guard of Angels is preſent in the places of Worſhip. For the firſt of theſe, it were eaſie to ſhew from ſeveral Scripture inſtances, that Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Preſence is ſet out by his Guard and Retinue of Angels.<note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. As our <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> and <hi>Aynſworth,</hi> and others, by adding the particles <hi>As in.</hi> As in <hi>Sinai in the Sanctuary,</hi> or <hi>Holy place.</hi> Then the meaning is beſt known by refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt clauſe, to the words fore-going,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49488:53"/>(as wee know tranſpoſitions very uſual in Scripture as well as other Authors) Thus, <hi>The Lord is with them</hi> [or <hi>among them</hi>] <hi>in the Sanctuary,</hi> as in <hi>Sinai.</hi> Now how was the Lord with the Angels in Mount <hi>Sinai?</hi> I have ſhewed before, as in the midſt of his Train and Retinue: So that the Law which was given by God unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Angels being preſent, is ſaid to be given <hi>by</hi> them; or it is all one, if wee gather onely thus much, that the Law was given, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>among</hi> them, they being then as an heavenly Army attending upon God at that preſent; and though <hi>Moſes</hi> never expreſſed this, yet it may clearly be gathered out of the New Teſtament, from three places. Thus likewiſe is the Lord with them in the Sanctuary,<note place="margin">Act. 7.53 Gal. 3.19 Heb. 2.2</note> to evidence which, the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim were placed upon the Ark, which was the place of his ſpecial reſidence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I finde the <hi>Ellipſis</hi> otherwiſe ſupplied by the LXX. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>The Lord is in them in Sinai, in the Sanctuary.</hi> And this I take to bee an <hi>Aſyndeton,</hi> and the ſenſe then to run thus, and the Lord is among them, both, as hee declared his ſpecial Preſence in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and alſo in the Sanctuary, whether wee take the Sanctuary for the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49488:53"/>or the <hi>Temple,</hi> Gods ſpecial Preſence in both, was by the Angels. Of which I come now to ſpeak, it being the ſecond thing to be made good.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Now that this Train and Retinue of Angels is preſent in the places of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip will be evident from thoſe places, which in deſcribing Gods Preſence there, do immediately make mention of the Angels. Thus the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>

Now the great trade the Devil drives, is to hinder our Communion with God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; <hi>Here</hi> we may finde many devils to tempt us, diſtract us, and ſo rob us of that which is the Kernel, the very Marrow and Quinteſſence of all our performances, <hi>viz.</hi> the enjoyment of God and Chriſt in them; Is there not reaſon then to extend their Miniſtration mainly to the Saints worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and ſerving God?

The reaſon or argument enforcing it is the ſame, becauſe, as that was an high inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, ſo alſo is ſleeping and lazyneſs in the Worſhip and Service of God. What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter argument of careleſſe and carnal minds, than mens ſleepy drowſineſſe under Gods Word? Muſt it not needs be a great offence to theſe Holy Spirits, to ſee ſome as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly compoſe themſelves to ſleep, as if it were one great part of that Homage and Worſhip, that is due unto God? Or as if they did verily expect, that God would deal with them, as with ſome of his ſervants, of old, that he would ſpeak to them in a <hi>dream?</hi> It is a moſt lamentable temper, when mens lazineſs and ſleepineſs in the Congregation,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49488:62"/>declare to all that are preſent, that they have no mind to be taken with Divine Truths, unleſs God take them <hi>napping.</hi> 'Tis dangerous to ſleep after taking of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> it may not onely hinder its <hi>working,</hi> but <hi>destroy</hi> the <hi>Patient:</hi> Thus it is like to be damnable, to be frequently ſleeping, when wee ſhould not onely receive Phyſick, but food for our ſouls, from the Word of God. Naturaliſts tell us, that ſleep is cauſed by the vapours that aſcend out of the ſtomach into the head: And muſt not thoſe hearts needs be very full of vapours, the curſed vapours of ſin and carnality, that produce the ſpiritual drowſineſs of the mind, and very often a down-right lazineſs and ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the body too, under the Preaching of the Word. However wee may conclude, as Philoſophers do, that fleep hath a good end in nature, <hi>ſaelus animalium,</hi> the health of the body; but ſleeping under the means of grace hath as ill an end as wee can well imagine, <hi>ruina animae,</hi> the deſtruction of the ſoul; and ſo muſt needs be very offenſive to the good Angels, who do rejoyce at the good of our Immortal Spirits.</p>
               <p>§ 3. 3. It may be a matter of caution to us; That though Angels are preſent as our Guardians, and Aſſiſters of us in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49488:62"/>Publick Aſſemblies, yet neither there, nor elſewhere, are they to be made the object; of our Worſhip and Adoration. Though they help the Saints of God to worſhip him, yet they muſt not have that Worſhip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe 'tis due onely unto God, <hi>Non minus veneratione offenduntur, quam turpitudine.</hi> They are no leſs offended with Worſhip given unto them, than they are with our indecency, and irreverence in the Worſhip of God. Wee do not ſo aſſert the Angels Preſence, as to deny the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God: And therefore 'tis little elſe than down-right ſottiſhneſs, and ignorance, that cryes up Angel-Worſhip as a great <hi>Diana;</hi> and that makes any to own them, as Mediators and Interceſſors, and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to offer up, and carry our prayers unto Chriſt, which is to rob Chriſt of that Glory that is due to him, and incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to any meer creature. For 'tis Chriſt alone that is <hi>the Angel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 8.3.</note> that offers up our prayers unto God. A full place to evidence the unlawfulneſs of Angel-Worſhip, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. <hi>And I fell at his feet to worſhip him,</hi>

               <p>§ 1.<note place="margin">II. Arg</note> A Second Argument to demonſtrate Gods Preſence, is taken from the Word of God. Reading and Preaching the Word, are owned as two ſtanding parts of Gods Publick Worſhip, and Gods Preſence is diſcovered in both. A Kings preſence (that is but finite in his perſon) is vertual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there where his commands and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49488:63"/>are made known; much more is God (who is infinite in his Eſſence, and Immenſe in his Being) ſpecially preſent there, where his Word is made known ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his command. As there is but one true Happineſs, <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> one giver of it, <hi>God;</hi> One Mediator, <hi>Jeſus Christ:</hi> So there is but one certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible means of imparting of it, the <hi>revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Will and Word of God:</hi> In the which, God ſhews his ſpecial Preſence; and as both an Author and Finiſher of every good thing for us, doth both begin and perfect all in the ſoul for its ſalvation. This, and the following Argument, I ſhall endeavour to proſecute in a more plain, familiar, and practical manner, and that God is preſent in and by his Word, will appear,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that the Word of God is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of converting ſouls. When men of unbeleevers, come to beleeve by the Word, 'tis an evident ſign of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with it. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi>

               <p>§ 2. 2. Gods Preſence is diſcovered in his Word, in that it reaches to the very heart. It is Gods priviledge to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a knower and ſearcher of the heart: And if at any time the heart bee troubled and affected with the Word of God, muſt wee not needs ſay, of a truth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.24, 25.</note> God was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his Word. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. <hi>If all Propheſie;</hi> (that is, thoſe that are in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and appointed by others for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which is clear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29.) <hi>And there come in one that beleeveth not, or one unlearned, hee is convinced of all, hee is Judged of all.</hi> verſ. 25. <hi>And thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt, and ſo falling down on his face, he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</hi> This is the work of the Word of God Preached to convince mens hearts, to judge them for their ſins, and thoſe thus wrought upon, muſt acknowledge Gods ſpecial Preſence in his Ordinances; ſuch will ſay, <hi>God is in you of a truth.</hi> No greater ſign of a barren, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and ſenſeleſſe heart in the things of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49488:66"/>God, than to condemn the Word Preached as barren and unfruitful; When any have been careleſſe and did not profit under the means, they have ſadly and uncharitably judged the Word it ſelf carnal and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, when alas, Lapwing-like, they keep far enough off from the eggs of iniquity that are hatching within; they look not to their own hearts where all the fault lyes. Oh! what thin Congregations ſhould wee have throughout this Nation, if all ſhould throw off Ordinances, or bee compelled to leave them, that never yet profited by them? How much better were it to ſit down and mourn over thoſe wretched, baſe, and rebellious hearts of ours, that have been the cauſe of all our fruitleſſeneſſe, under the powerful Preaching, of the heart-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſoul-riſling Word of God. Let us be ſure to look well to the Word what it is in it ſelf, and not what it proves by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our corruption; if ever wee would have right apprehenſions of the Preaching of the Goſpel; and not undervalue and ſleight the publick means of Grace, becauſe ſome men either have not been bettered, or do not at preſent profit under them.</p>
               <p>§ 3. But I ſhall further evidence, that the Word reaches to our hearts upon this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49488:66"/>four-fold conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The VVord doth diſcover mens ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts; take them in the fulleſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, all ſorts of thoughts. Have you not been ſometimes at a Sermon, where you have plainly heard thoſe very things that have been formerly working in your thoughts? Nay, have you not ſometimes fooliſhly ſuſpected, that ſome one or other hath told the Preacher your very ſtate and condition, or elſe hee could never have ſpoke ſo cloſely, diſtinctly, and directly to it? Lay by all ſuch fond jealouſies and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſuſpitions for the future, and know 'tis the VVord of God that is preached to you, and this reaches to your very thoughts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of humane information. <hi>It is a diſcerner of the thoughts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The VVord diſcovers the moſt ſecret ſins of mens hearts; Hath not the VVord told you of that many times, which you thought, none in the world knew you were guilty of? Have you not ſometimes heard thoſe ſecret ſins and miſcarriages reproved in publick, that you have been guilty of in private, and you thought till you heard it reproved, that none was ever guilty of ſuch ſins but your ſelf? As I have known a very gracious Chriſtian, when he heard
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49488:67"/>
                  <hi>fearfulneſſe of the Devil, in ſecret Prayer,</hi> reproved as a great peece of our unbeleef, and that ſome were ſo fearfully miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to this, that they would ſometimes ſtart aſide and look behind them, to ſee whether the Devil were not really preſent there or no; hee told the Miniſter, that this was <hi>his</hi> very miſcarriage, and withall thought that none had ever been thus foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly fearful and guilty of that but himſelf. VVhat made <hi>Felix</hi> to tremble when hee heard <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſe of <hi>Temperance, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and Judgement</hi> to come? VVhy 'twas the VVord of God that hee heard preached that came cloſe to his conſcience, and told him of his intemperance, and unrighteouſneſſe, that cauſed this <hi>collick</hi> in the conſcience that produced this <hi>Aguiſh</hi> ſit of <hi>trembling</hi> in the Noble <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi> VVhen the VVord powerfully rifles a mans conſcience, and ſets his boſome ſins in order before his eyes, is it from Man, or from God? VVee muſt acknowledge, 'tis the VVord of God, and not of man that does it; even that VVord that reaches mans heart, and diſcovers thoſe ſecret ſins there, and this manifeſts Gods Preſence by his VVord. VVhat is it that makes the hearts of <hi>Kings</hi> to ſtoop, and their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49488:67"/>to be ſtartled upon the diſcovery of their ſins, as <hi>Sauls</hi> was, when <hi>Samuel</hi> told him of his diſobedience to God?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.24</note> Is it the word of man that is thus formidable to them? alas! this cannot be, when man hath no <hi>coercive</hi> or <hi>compulſive</hi> power over <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> and the ſharpeſt menaces of mortal men, cannot make theſe Pillars of the Earth to ſhake. Muſt it not then be the Word of that God, that doth this, to whom <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Scepters</hi> muſt vail, and yeeld obedience? And if the Word at any time produces ſuch a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful amazement in the heart of Majeſty it ſelf, muſt wee not ſay, <hi>God is in that Word of a truth?</hi> Men are apt to think well enough of themſelves, till the Word reveals their ſins to them; then they ſee much ſin, they took no notice of before, when once the Word of God comes cloſe to the conſcience. This was the caſe of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.7, 9</note> 
                  <hi>I had not known ſin but by the Law: For I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>For I was alive without the Law once, but when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came, ſin revived, and I dyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Word meets with, and anſwers the ſcruples of doubting ſouls; whence is this but from Gods Preſence with the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49488:68"/>Word? Have not many ſouls experienced the Word to come cloſe to their very doubts, and to have ſatisfied them? When labouring under unbeleef, it hath much informed their minds; when fearing Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, by it they have ſeen ſolid grounds for perſeverance; the Word teaching, that they are <hi>kept by the Power of God, through Faith, unto eternal ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Word affords ſuitable comforts to particular caſes of the ſoul, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted conſciences. No <hi>cure</hi> for the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſives</hi> of the world, like to thoſe <hi>Cordials</hi> of <hi>Comfort</hi> out of the Word. No plaiſter for a wounded conſcience, like to the <hi>Balm of Gilead,</hi> purchaſed by Chriſt, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Word, alwaies to be found ready for the uſe of ſaving Faith, in the boxes of Goſpel-Promiſes. It was the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Word of God, to back and ſtrengthen our ſouls with comfort in this life, upon well-grounded hopes of life in the world to come.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.4</note> 
                  <hi>For whatſoever things were written afore-time, were written for our learning, that wee through patience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> Theſe are all matters of experience, and I dare appeal to the hearts of Gods Children for the truth of them. Have you not had your
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49488:68"/>thoughts diſcerned? your ſecret ſins diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered? your doubts anſwered, and ſuitable comforts given in at Sermons? Whence comes all this? Alas! the Preacher is but a finite creature, and is no more able of himſelf to reach mens hearts, and particular caſes, than hee is to create a world. Well! but though the Preacher cannot, yet the Word preached can; and this ſpeaks Gods Preſence with his Word.</p>
               <p>§ 4. 3. The Word of God preſſes thoſe duties, and diſcovers thoſe Truths which muſt needs own God for their Author, and this alſo ſpeaks the Preſence of God with his Word. As Gods People are his <hi>Segul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note place="margin">Hab. 2.4</note> in the ſervice of their Saviour. Neither is this an idle notion, or a meer ſpeculation, 'tis the very life of the Saints practice, as wee ſee by St. <hi>Paul. The life which I now live in the fleſh,</hi>

To mind things that are above, is quite croſſe to our natural inclinations, and our carnal deſires.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49488:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>firſt riſing. This is a peculiar injunction of the VVord of God, to promote inward mortification of the whole body of ſin, and all the members thereof. And this ſpeaks,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> A ſerious purpoſe of reſiſting of ſin, and this turns the heart from the waies of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> An avoiding all the occaſions of ſin, this keeps the heart from returning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A daily uſe of the beſt means to ſubdue ſin, this helps us to a conſtancy in our purpoſe againſt ſin, that wee may proſperouſly go on in this work of God.</p>
               <p>§ 8. 4. Inward Humility of the mind. <hi>Be clothed with Humility,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pet. 5.5</note> 1 Pet. 5.5. To make Humility the inward ornament of the ſoul, is onely an effect of the VVord of God, which no other Rules can reach unto. And herein the VVord of God is no waies <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,</hi> in this Rule for our inward ſoul-adorning. If wee conſider man, either as a creature depending upon God, or as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creature defiled with Original ſin; or as a renewed creature, accompliſhed with grace (the free iſſue and product of Gods diſtinguiſhing mercy) who may by grace become ſincere, but can never be made innocent; or as one endowed with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

Such like conſiderations as theſe are, ſpeaks it highly <hi>rational</hi> for a man to be truly humble. The higheſt Moraliſts are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this ſpiritual duty, becauſe they are unacquainted with thoſe preſſing motives, that the Word of God urges us to humility with. Let never ſo great a ſhew of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be made; if wee own not the Word to teach us, our very humility will diſcover our pride. Wee may perhaps make a ſhew of humility, becauſe there is ſome real comelineſs in that grace, but not in that way, or manner, that the Word directs us, and ſo wee diſcover our pride, in that wee will not be beholding to the Word to teach us. Such duties as theſe are, come not from corrupt nature, nor indeed can they; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing croſſes it more than theſe. VVe need not ſuſpect the Devil to have a hand in the putting of us upon the ſincere practice of theſe; for they all do immediately tend to over-turn his Kingdome. But the VVord of God, which wee read and preach, drives mainly at theſe, and ſo it evinces Gods ſpecial Preſence in his VVord, which is the promoter of ſuch ſpiritual duties.</p>

The VVord ſeparated from Faith profiteth nothing; not as if the efficacy of the Word did depend upon us, or any thing in us.

Thus do not Gods Truths fare the better many

Let us bleſſe God, that he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his VVord for our direction, and that he continues the Preaching of the VVord for our inſtruction. O how glad would the Martyrs of old have been, with our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, of enjoying the publick means of hearing the VVord Read and Preached? They that joyfully hugged ſome few ſcraps of the Bible in a corner, and counted the dark Caverns of the Earth, rich <hi>Temples,</hi> when they, though ſecretly, and in the night, could enjoy the preſence of God in his Word: Oh how thankful would they have been for ſuch overflowings of mercy, as now may be enjoyed, which ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely abuſe, and others blaſphemouſly undervalue, and wilfully contemn.

                  <hi>and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth mee, and hee that deſpiſeth mee, deſpiſeth him that ſent mee.</hi> Here 'tis plain and clear, that Chriſt by his miniſters ſpeaketh unto us, they are but Chriſts <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain Chriſts Perſon; And therefore he will have the Word of God by them delivered, heard ſo, as if Chriſt himſelf were perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally preſent and did Officiate amongſt them.

               <p>§ 2. This is ſo certain a Truth, that if the <hi>Miniſter be bad,</hi> yet if hee preach the <hi>pure Word of God,</hi> wee muſt receive the Word,

'Tis not the perſon, but the office; not the man, but his Miniſtry; not his life, but his Doctrine, wee are to look to.

                  </note> God oftentimes honours the Office, and ſo orders, that a wicked perſon in a good Office, may perform ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what helping forward our Salvation. If God doth a good work by bad men, wee muſt not reject the work for the perſons ſake, but wee muſt rather embrace the good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered or done by bad men, and leave them to ſtand, or fall, to their own Maſter.

Thus wee ſee, that ſeed which is ſown by a foul diſeaſed hand may bring forth fruit, as well as that which is ſown by a clean hand. Give mee leave to allude to that paſſage, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.6. God there in a time of hunger and want, commands the Ravens (unclean
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49488:80"/>Birds) to feed the Prophet <hi>Elijah. The Ravens brought him bread and fleſh, morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening.</hi> They were Ravens, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> not Doves, yet <hi>Elijah</hi> refuſes not the meat, becauſe God ſends them.<note place="margin">Chemnit. Harmon. in Evangelia.</note> This <hi>Chemnitius</hi> thinks hath a myſtery, that God is wont ſometimes to afford to his people the wholeſome food of his Word, by the hands of wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men. Thou therefore, hear, receive, and mingle by Faith what thou heareſt, take whatſoever God ſendeth, as from the hand of God. Be it a <hi>Raven,</hi> or a <hi>Dove,</hi> thou needeſt not trouble thy ſelf, ſo the food come from God. <hi>Elijah</hi> might have ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if hee had refuſed the food, becauſe the Ravens brought it. So mayeſt thou ſtarve thy ſoul by nouriſhing prejudices againſt the Miniſter that is ſent with food for thy ſoul from God, and then refuſe the Word, becauſe thou diſlikeſt ſomething in the Miniſters perſon. And indeed if this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple once prevail, <hi>That a Miniſter ought not to be heard that is ungodly;</hi> Though hee preaches nothing but ſound doctrine. It would lay a certain foundation for <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> from the outward means and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, at leaſt from the adminiſtration of them, as now they are enjoyed. For the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49488:81"/>caſe would preſently return hither, as it is with many already, not whether the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter be really ungodly or no, but whether hee ſeems ſo to them; and if hee anſwers not thoſe characters of Godlineſs, they have laid down then they are obliged to hear him no more. Such ſad works do bad principles, and erronious conſciences make in the Church of God. A ſad example of this may be ſeen among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who upon the ſore-mentioned principle, reject and throw off all the now Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no difference; becauſe they are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, being all guilty of that great abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and <hi>ſinful oppreſſion</hi> of <hi>taking Tithes.</hi> How much better may wee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thus, <hi>Officium eſt Sanctum &amp; honore digniſsimum licet Miniſtri ſunt peccatores.</hi> The office of the Miniſtry is ſacred, and moſt worthy of honour, though Miniſters may be ungodly. The promiſe of Chriſts Preſence is made to perſons for the office ſake, and not to the office for the perſons, and ſo to the office more than to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Loe I am with you alway to the end of the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28 20</note> Chriſts promiſe was to the office primarily, ſecondarily to thoſe that then were, and ſucceſſively ſhould be entred into it, to do Chriſts ſervice, and preach the

               <p>§ 3. 1. Goſpel Miniſters are Gods <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors;</hi> this ſpeaks Gods Preſence by them.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20</note> 
                  <hi>Now therefore wee are Embaſſadors for Chriſt.</hi> The very office of an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, is to be but a <hi>Vicarius</hi> to another; Hee is a Proxy to his Maſter, and bears his perſon; who is ſometimes thus deſcribed, <hi>Legatus est officialis, qui alterius locum te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</hi>

The Angels are Gods Servants too, being his Miniſtring Spirits, but to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49488:85"/>which of the Angels hath God ſaid at any time they are his fellow-labourers? Both waies the Preſence of God is evidenced, with the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God is the principal cauſe, man onely by the Miniſtry of the Word is the inſtrumental cauſe, and ſo Gods glory, and mans duty, may very well ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In ſaving Faith, wee muſt diſtinguiſh theſe two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There is the knowledge of the things to be beleeved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> An aſſent of the heart to thoſe <hi>credenda,</hi> or things to be beleeved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Then the knowledge of things to be beleeved, ariſeth from the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Goſpel-Miniſters. Goſpel ſaving knowledge is not communicated now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, by revelations, and immediate inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but by the Word preached and heard.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14 See Rom. 1.16</note> 
                  <hi>How ſhall they beleeve on him, of whom they have not heard, and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> Now Miniſters are co-workers with God, becauſe Faith
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49488:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>depends on the Word preached by them, as a neceſſary Inſtrument, for its produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as to the knowledge of things to be beleeved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for that Internal Aſſent of the heart, whereby a Beleever doth firmly apprehend, and comfortably apply the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine propounded, of things to be beleeved; this ariſeth from the habit of Faith infuſed by Gods Spirit. The <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> is preached and promulged by men, herein they are co-workers with God: But the <hi>habit of Faith,</hi> that is infuſed and implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God alone, without any concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Preacher; Thus it is <hi>the gift of God.</hi> Man propounds truths to the ſoul by his preaching; God by his Spirit makes us beleeve thoſe Truths preached and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.

As Co-workers with God. People muſt eye God and not men. Prize Goſpel truths. Not be prejudiced againſt, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluers of Goſpel Miniſters. Good grounds for Miniſters to Preach, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to hear.</head>
               <p>§ 1. FRom this third <hi>Argument</hi> to prove Gods Preſence in Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as being repreſented by the Miniſters of the Goſpel; Theſe <hi>practical deductions,</hi> might be proſecuted, and enlarged upon, which I ſhall briefly name, and come to the fourth and laſt Argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It informs Miniſters of two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Of their Dignity; That God ſhould ſet them in the Church, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Majeſty of Heaven. This ought not to puff up pride in Miniſters, but to cauſe humble admiration of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to honour their weakneſſe ſo farre, as to be the repreſentatives of God himſelf.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49488:86"/>This may vindicate them from contempt amongſt men. An affront is offered to the Prince, by affronting of his Embaſſador: So God is affronted by any indignities that are offered to His Miniſters. <hi>He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>deſpiſeth not man, but God. Corinth</hi> was ruined by the <hi>Romans,</hi> for abuſe of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors: And it were juſt with God to deſtroy any place or perſon for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Miniſters.</p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it informs Miniſters of their duty. Gods Preſence with them calls for a three-fold duty from them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As Embaſſadors, they muſt eye that mainly that God ſent them about, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſalvation of Souls. <hi>Wee pray you in Chriſts ſtead be yee reconciled to God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20.</note> Here is the main end of our Preaching, and your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that you may be reconciled. How then can any have ſo impudent a face, as to pretend they are ſent of God, who make railing and reviling of others, to bee their work, with a neglect of the ſalvation of Souls, and holding out the VVord of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
               <p>§ 3. 2. As Stewards of the myſteries of God, they muſt bee faithful.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.2.</note> 
                  <hi>It's required in Stewards that they be faithful.</hi> That is, that they keep nothing back from the people of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49488:87"/>God, but diſcover to them according to their ability the whole councel and will of God, that they deal faithfully with them in all things, that they may render a good account of their Stewardſhip at the great Audit. Now this faithfulneſſe of Gods Stewards is ſeen in theſe two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Davenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius in</hi> Col. c. 1. v. 7.</note> that they ſeek Gods honour, and not their own praiſe. Hee ſeeks the glory and honour of God, <hi>that ſpeaks as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of God, that God in all things may bee glorified through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.11.</note> Hee ſeeks praiſe of men, that ſo ſpeaks that hee may pleaſe men, that hee may fan to himſelf ſome praiſe from them, for his wit, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and learning. Of this hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vain glory, and popular applauſe, St. <hi>Paul</hi> with diſdain enough thus ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.10</note> 
                  <hi>Do I ſeek to pleaſe men? For if I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not bee the ſervant of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That to their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they promote the ſpiritual good, and eternal welfare of the Flock committed to their charge, by watching over them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring ſuitable food for their ſouls, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their capacities and conditions, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing that is neceſſary, and doing nothing that is prejudicial to their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. An example of this wee have emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49488:87"/>in St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Even as I pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking mine own profit but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. 3. As Co-workers with God. They muſt be diligent. If wee work with God, we muſt be diligent in our employment, leaſt wee ruine our ſelves, as well as wrong o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Souls, and diſhonour God by our careleſneſſe and indiligence. <hi>Prayer, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> and <hi>Affliction,</hi> contribute much to the making of a Divine: The two former, ſpeak that care and diligence that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the Miniſterial Office, the other God uſes as his laſh to prevent lazineſſe, and as a Spur to quicken to Duty. He that works together with God for the good of Souls, had need bee very diligent, In that men muſt have more than Sermons to lead them: The viſible Preachings of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters lives, muſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> co-operate, and joyn in the work of drawing ſinners unto God, or elſe will hardly prove ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeful.</p>
               <p>§ 5. II. Gods preſence with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, teaches the people to eye God more, and men leſſe, in the Miniſtry of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. It is an ill ſign of a ſqueamiſh Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, not to take meat down, unleſſe it be dreſſed by ſuch an hand; And as ill a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49488:88"/>ſign of a diſtempered heart, not to receive the Word cheerfully and readily, unleſſe delivered by ſuch and ſuch Miniſters. This wee have by eying men more than God. Three directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Own and prize Goſpel truths, by whom ever they are delivered.</hi> An unclean hand may convey to you a precious Jewel, A wooden pipe may convey to you rich and generous Wine. Wee muſt have truth in admiration for Gods ſake, and not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Goſpel truths becauſe wee have the perſons in admiration that do deliver them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Let not prejudice againſt mens perſons, cauſe in you a prajudice againſt the doctrine they preach.</hi> The beſt way is to keep all prejudices againſt any out of out hearts, the next is to throw them out ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, when wee perceive they have cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly crept into us. Prejudices, againſt Miniſters if harboured in our breaſts any time, will bee very apt to make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous againſt God; And to contemn the truths of God, if upon any private grudge wee condemn the party that brings them. It's <hi>weakneſſe</hi> to entertain groundleſs prejudices againſt Miniſters; but it is <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe</hi> then to take revenge upon our
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49488:88"/>own Souls; And either in a pet to throw off hearing wholly, or not to embrace the word heard chearfully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Let not the meanneſſe of mens parts cauſe you to ſleight or undervalue Gods Ordinances.</hi> There are divers gifts, yet but one ſpirit. There is much of Gods power ſeen in mans weakneſſe. If good men are without great <hi>parts,</hi> they are without that great <hi>pride</hi> that does attend them. And then thoſe Sermons that have onely the <hi>plain trimming</hi> of <hi>Holineſſe</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> as moſt befitting the ſimplicity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are moſt operative upon hearers. How ordinary is it, for great and learned Doctors, to leave their people meer dunces in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Now others, what they want in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and parts, God many times helps out by their tenderneſſe of affection for the good of Souls, and this is ordinarily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Gods bleſſing.</p>
               <p>§ 6. <hi>III.</hi> Gods Preſence with his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, affords good ground enough for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to preach, and people to hear. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances will continue, as long as Chriſts promiſe continues, and preſence with the Miniſters, and that is to the end of the world. If any do abſent themſelves or would with-draw others, from hearing the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49488:89"/>Word publickly Preached, let them firſt prove that Chriſts promiſe is out of date, then may wee have reaſon to beleeve that hearing and preaching are out of date too. Till that bee done, let us aſſure our ſelves, that the enjoyment of Publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Preſence of Chriſt in them, is the onely ſafe and ſure way, for us to walk to the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Gods Preſence in his Worſhip, by the Holy Spirit. The Preſence of the Spirit proved by ſundry Texts of Scripture. The Word and Spirit go together. The teaching of the Spirit, no plea for Enthuſiaſm. The Word of the Goſpel, the miniſtration of the Spirit. Ten Reaſons grounded on experience, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing the Preſence, and teaching of the Spirit in the Word.</head>
               <p>§ 1. THe <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt <hi>Argument</hi> to prove the Preſence of God in Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Religious Worſhip, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>4</label> is drawn from the efficacious, and powerful working of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> The Spirits aſſiſtance is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49488:89"/>neceſſary in all duties of Goſpel-Worſhip. As vital and animal ſpirits are neceſſary for all operations of life and ſenſe in the body; ſo the Holy Spirit for works of the ſoul in all Goſpel-duties. Before Chriſts coming, the great thing under promiſe, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant expectation, was the coming of the true <hi>Meſſias:</hi> After Chriſts Aſcenſion, the great thing under promiſe, and in conſtant expectation, was the full manifeſtation and ſhedding abroad of the Spirit of God. Now this was abundantly fulfilled after Chriſts Aſcenſion. But what I have to ſpeak to, lyes mainly in this, that there is the ſpecial Preſence, and Operation of the Spirit of God in his Ordinances, eſpecially in his Word. This being manifeſted, will fully evidence, that the place of Gods Worſhip, is the place of Gods ſingular Preſence. The Preſence of Gods Spirit ſhall be cleared, both by Scriptures, and Reaſons, grounded upon undeniable experiences of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</p>
               <p>§ 2. When God by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> declared the promiſes of the Kingdome of Chriſt, hee makes a gracious promiſe of his Spiritual Preſence with them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.26. <hi>I will ſet my Sanctuary in the midſt of them, for evermore,</hi> that is, I will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49488:90"/>in my Grace, Word and Spirit, in their Aſſemblies,<note place="margin">See c. 4. § 11, 14</note> and in their heart; of which Spiritual Preſence the Tabernacle and Sanctuary heretofore were ſigns and pledges. And that this Preſence of the Spirit is to be had and enjoyed in theſe times of the Goſpel, will be evident from theſe following places. I ſhall begin with the Evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 59.21</note> 
                  <hi>As for moe, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the</hi> Lord; <hi>My Spirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put into thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the</hi> Lord, <hi>from henceforth and for ever.</hi> In this full place God hath joyned his Spirit and his Word together. God hath left the footſteps of his bounty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, for the advantage of the Church, yet no greater than this, to have his Word and Spirit to guide them unto Heaven. The Spirit is joyned with the Word, becauſe without the Efficacy, and Preſence of the Spirit, the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would be unprofitable. And the Word too muſt be joyned with the Spirit, becauſe as one obſerves,<note place="margin">Calvin in Locum.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſt Satanae ſpiritus qui di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellitur a verbo,</hi> it is no better nor worſe (if worſe could be) than the Spirit of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49488:90"/>Devil, that is ſeparated from the Word of God. Wee may have the Devil deluding, but no promiſe of Gods teaching, when the Spirit is pretended, without the Word. Now where are wee to have this? <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>In thy mouth</hi>] Spoken to the Prophet, implying a Miniſtry of the Word under the Goſpel, to hold this out. God might indeed ſpeak to us immediately from Heaven, or uſe the Miniſtry of Angels. But God conſulting with our weakneſs, uſeth the Miniſtry of Man rather, like our ſelves, to deliver his mind to us, that by that means, wee may the more familiarly be drawn unto him. In vain do any boaſt that they obey God, when they reject his Miniſters. If they obey God, why not in Gods way, who hath appointed Goſpel-Miniſters to hold out his Word, and hath promiſed the Preſence of his Spirit, to beat us off from ſuch fancies and deluſions, which would make us gape after revelations <hi>without,</hi> and many times <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to the Word of God.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Another place of the ſame Prophet.<note place="margin">Iſa. 54.13.</note> 
                  <hi>And all thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord.</hi> God is wont to teach his children two waies, by the outward Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by the ſecret revelation of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, working by the Word: Now which is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49488:91"/>meant here, the Evangeliſt <hi>John, Joh.</hi> 6.45. ſhews us. <hi>The Father draws ſouls to Chriſt.</hi> But how? <hi>It is written, they ſhall be all taught of God.</hi> All Gods children ſhall be clearly taught by the Spirit of God. The elect ones that are drawn home to Chriſt, are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> taught of God, not in <hi>oppoſition,</hi> but in <hi>ſubordination</hi> to the Word. 'Tis not to <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> but to <hi>aſſert</hi> the <hi>eſſicacy</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mareſ. L. Com. Lo. <hi>1.</hi> ſſ. <hi>51.</hi>
                  </note> For as one well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <q>wee are ſaid to be taught of God, in that place of <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. So far as that the Doctrine, which outwardly ſounds in the Scripture, and Miniſtry of the Word, is imprinted in our minds by the Spirit of God, not as if wee ſhould receive new revelations without the uſe of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means.</q> Wee muſt ſo <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> the Miniſtry of the Word, and the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit, ſo as not to give the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious teaching of the heart, unto man who preaches the Word. For ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayes, the Sons of the Church of Chriſt are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>taught of God.</hi> And as <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>

                  <hi>Cathedram in coelis habet qui corda docet,</hi> Hee that teaches the heart is Doctor of the Chair in the New <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Yet wee muſt not <hi>divide and ſeparate them,</hi> as if Gods teaching, and the Spirits teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49488:91"/>in Goſpel-times, were without the Word preached. The Spirit of God teaches in the Church, and Ordinances there. <hi>Diſcipuli ſunt Diaboli non Dei,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calvinus in</hi> Iſa. 54.13</note> 
                  <hi>qui ordinem a Deo inſtitutum repudiant,</hi> They are the Devils Scholars, and none of Gods Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who do reject that order that God hath appointed. Wee ſee theſe joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Children of the Church, and taught of God; ſo that they are not the Diſciples and Children of God, that will not be taught in the Church.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Another place is that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>As touching Brotherly Love, I need not write unto you; for yee are all taught of God, to love one another.</hi> The meaning is, I need not now uſe many words to you, to treat at large about bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Love. <hi>A word is enough to the wiſe.</hi> You that are made wiſe by the Spirit of God, know at firſt what the duty means, an admonition is enough. God teaches you by the Word, and you know what that is by the Spirit. Hee doth not ſo ſpeak, as if they that were taught of God, <hi>had no need of the Word.</hi> But onely thus much hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that when once the Spirit teaches in the Word, there is <hi>leſs labour on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters parts</hi> to teach, than where the Spirit
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49488:92"/>hath not taught at all. And truly woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth demonſtrate this. A gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart that is taught by the Spirit in the Word, apprehends a Divine Truth, or Goſpel-duty at firſt mentioning. As the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that were taught of God need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely the very mentioning of the duty of Brotherly Love. But what ado have wee, to beat a Goſpel-Truth, into the head, or heart, or memory, of a carnal wretch? Goſpel-Truths are hidden Myſteries, dark ſayings, obſcure parables, to natural hearts: They cannot apprehend what they mean, and whither they tend ordinarily. Or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Miniſter hath been beating a long time upon ſuch Truths, poſſibly a carnal mans underſtanding, may under the preaching of the Word, obtain the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon work of Illumination, and hee may know many things; yea but what is this all this while to the reformation of the heart, to the working upon the affections? this muſt be by the teaching of the Spirit of God in his Ordinances. Mans preaching may fill the head full of notions, but the Spirits teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt fill the heart with real notions of grace and goodneſs towards God. As long as you hear onely with the hearing of the ear, the Word preached profiteth not; but
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49488:92"/>when you are taught of God by his Spirit, then the Word gets within you into your very hearts.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Look alſo into that place of <hi>John; It is the Spirit that quickeneth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6.63</note> 
                  <hi>the fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing, the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life.</hi> The Diſciples thought it an hard ſaying, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 55. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed.</hi> Though it was not the ſaying, but the hardneſs of their hearts that made it ſo. But Chriſt here anſwers; <hi>The fleſh profiteth nothing</hi>] that is, my Humane Nature without the Spirit, without my Divine Nature, can never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you life. All that I have done or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, in the fleſh, is worth nothing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe life and ſalvation, unleſs I were God as well as man. 'Tis the Spirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth; my <hi>Deity,</hi> as I am God, that makes mee capable of obtaining life for ſouls, by offering my fleſh a ſacrifice to Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And <hi>the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life</hi>] The Word of Chriſt is the Inſtrument the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit maketh uſe of to beget life in the ſoul, by working Faith. Chriſts very Sermon could do no good in order to the producing of life in the ſoul, were it not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:49488:93"/>
               <p>§ 6. I ſhall onely hint at one place more. It's very obſervable, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Goſpel, <hi>The Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.8</note> becauſe of the Spirits Preſence with the Word, and becauſe it hath the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Spirit joyned with it. For the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this, obſerve a twofold op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition betwixt the Law and the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Law is called the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Letter,</hi> the Goſpel the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> The Law is called the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the <hi>Letter,</hi> becauſe whilſt it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or forbids us any thing, it affords no inward ſtrength at all, whereby the heart may have an inward obedience wrought in it; but onely propounds the external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, written in Tables of Stone, and therefore called the <hi>Letter.</hi> But the Goſpel, whilſt it declares remiſſion of ſins, and life eternal through Chriſt, it adminiſters alſo the help, aſſiſtance, and preſence of the Spirit by which Faith is ſtirred up in our hearts, whereby wee apply Chriſt himſelf, and all his benefits unto our ſouls; and therefore 'tis called the <hi>Miniſtration of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Law is called the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of <hi>Death,</hi> the Goſpel the Miniſtry of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> The one the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49488:93"/>of <hi>Death,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Letter, for the Letter killeth,</hi> whilſt it giveth no inward ſtrength or aſſiſtance, to yeeld obedience to thoſe commands it layes upon us; and ſo the fleſh and corrupt nature is more and more provoked, and becomes more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to death and ſin, than before. This is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. <hi>The Law gives occaſion to ſin to ſlay the man.</hi> The Goſpel is the Miniſtry of <hi>Life,</hi> becauſe it affordeth power, and the help of the Spirit, which produces Faith, by which Chriſt is applied to the ſoul, for life and ſalvation, ſo that by the Spirit, the Goſpel affordeth life to the beleeving ſoul. This made <hi>Paul</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20</note> 
                  <hi>the life which I now live, is by Faith in the Son of God.</hi> Take a Chriſtian without Faith, and you do unchriſtian him, hee is left as an ordinary man: So take the Goſpel without the Preſence of the Spirit, and it is but a <hi>dead Letter.</hi> That there is ſuch a Preſence of the Spirit, I have ſhewed by Scripture. The next thing is to ſhew it from reaſons grounded upon undeniable experiences. For the better apprehending of them, I have moulded them into ſo many practical Queries.</p>
               <p>§ 7. Qu. 1. <hi>What makes Gods Children, that have excellent Teachers, yet pray for the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49488:94"/>opening of their eyes, and ſpiritual illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> It is from their ſenſe and ſight, of the want of the Spirits teaching, to be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the preaching of men. Though <hi>David</hi> had <hi>Nathan</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> excellent Teachers, yet hee begged of God, that <hi>hee would open his eyes, that hee might ſee the wonderful things of his Law.</hi> All the light in the world cannot make a man ſee, if hee want a ſeeing faculty. The moſt raiſed Preaching can do as little good to the ſouls of men, if they have not ſpiritual eye-ſalve beſtowed upon them, to open the eyes of their dark underſtandings. Barrenneſs in Prayer, is ſeldome without unfruitfulneſs in hearing, becauſe they ſeldome get much good in hearing of the Word, that are not often begging the Spirits Preſence in the Word.</p>
               <p>§ 8. Qu. 2. <hi>What made ſo many that heard our Saviour Chriſt in the fleſh, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their unbeleef?</hi> Was it not becauſe they onely heard the Word of Chriſt, but had not the Spirit of Chriſt going along with it? How blinde were the <hi>Jews,</hi> even after Chriſt brought light into the world? They loved darkneſs rather than light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their deeds were evil. When the good Word of God comes to had hearts,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49488:94"/>unleſs the Spirit ſets it home effectually, to make them better, they ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worſe. For <hi>wicked men</hi> are much like <hi>Swine,</hi> turn their eyes up to the light, and they fall a <hi>crying;</hi> and bring the light of the Word to wicked hearts, and they fall a <hi>railing</hi> and <hi>reviling.</hi> Thus the Jews dealt with our Saviour. You would think it were an admirable way for converſion, to have heard Chriſt preaching to men; and truly ſo it was; yet wee ſee, many beleeved not. You may be ready to think the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preaching, <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> as many do; yet many have been converted by their teaching. Is it not ſtrange, that ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that heard Chriſt, ſhould go away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, that was God as well as Man? and that any ſhould be converted unto God, that hear ſinful men preach? Truly not at all; becauſe the Word of Chriſt went to ſome men, and was not ſet home by the Spirit. And the ſame Word and Goſpel-Truths, though preached by ſinful men, is accompanied with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that makes it effectual.</p>
               <p>§ 9. Qu. 3. <hi>What made</hi> Peter <hi>ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in his Miniſtry, that at one Sermon hee converted three thouſand ſouls?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2.41</note> 
                  <hi>And yet wee never read of ſuch a plentiful harveſt,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49488:95"/>gathered in at once, by our Saviour Chriſt.</hi> That chapter tells us, God had juſt then poured out the Spirit, which was the fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſion. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 33. There were the ſame Truths before, and one would have thought, a <hi>better Preacher,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf was in the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> And ſee how Chriſts Sermon takes with the people. From <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 31.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Is not this Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs Son?</hi> Inſtead of looking well at the Doctrine, they fall a cavilling at the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; a poor, mean, inconſiderable fellow, <hi>a Carpenters Son.</hi> Hee was then upon as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious matter as any in all the Book of God. Hee told them, what hee came into the world for, it was to do good, and to ſave ſouls, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 19. Enough to have melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hardeſt hearts, and humbled the proudeſt ſinners, if meer words would have done it; and 'tis ſaid, <hi>they all wondred at his gracious words,</hi> verſ. 22. Well! but ſee the iſſue of all. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>They were filled with wrath. Verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>They thruſt him out of the City,</hi> and indeavoured to tumble him down the Hill. You ſee here, their <hi>good will</hi> to Chriſt, notwithſtanding all his pains and preaching. Hee came to <hi>break their hearts,</hi> and they in recompence would have <hi>broke his neck.</hi> Hee preached to <hi>ſave</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:49488:95"/>their <hi>Souls,</hi> and they would have <hi>taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life.</hi> Certainly if Chriſt had ſo bad ſucceſſe, then <hi>Peter</hi> who denyed his <hi>Maſter,</hi> would have had far worſe, if worſe could be had. No ſuch matter! There was the Spirit powred out, and did powerfully ſet home the Word by <hi>Peter</hi>'s miniſtry, which Chriſt was not pleaſed to let work power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, upon the hearts of his hearers, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf. And that is the reaſon of that kind welcome the Word received. <hi>Now when they heard this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 2.37</note> 
                  <hi>they were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid unto Peter, and to the reſt of the Apoſtles; Men and Brethren, what ſhall wee do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 10. Quer. 4. <hi>What makes the ſame Preacher, ſucceſſeful at one place, and not at another?</hi> Onely this, that God accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies his Word, with his Spirit at one place, and not at another. Wee may ſuppoſe, the ſame Word Preached, to a different people, to a very different event. The one mock, raile, revile: The other, prove hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, meek, yea true converts. The Word is the ſame, all men by nature, have the ſame vileneſſe in their hearts, and oppoſition to the Word, and truths of the Goſpel. The difference then lyes, in the preſence of the Spirit of God. And now, that God is not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49488:96"/>alwaies preſent, by his Spirit, to ſet home the Word upon all; This ſhould not make us ſleight and neglect hearing, but make us more diligent in praying, that the Spirit may alwaies bee preſent with the Word, to render that which wee hear, truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally effectual to our ſouls.</p>
               <p>§ 11. Quer. 5. <hi>What makes the ſame truths, heard by the ſame man, at ſeveral times, produce different and ſeveral effects?</hi> Is it not wholly from the Spirit of God? One hath often heard of Chriſts death and paſſion, and ſufferings for mankind; of his tenderneſſe, love, and compaſſion, for the good of loſt, and undone ſouls: And this perhaps, hee hath not onely once, or twice, but many times heard, and yet no profit. Hee can ſtill boldly ſleight Chriſt, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely neglect his ſoul, and highly contemn the Goſpel, that offers him Chriſt, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt. At another time perhaps, this makes him quite another man. Is Chriſt dead for mee, and my ſins, and ſhall I love ſin more than my dear Saviour? Did Chriſt bleed, to cure the wounds of my Soul, and ſhall I wound Chriſt again by my curſed luſts? Did Chriſt deſcend from Heaven, to ſave mee out of Hell, and ſhall I ſleight his infinite condiſcenſion of love,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49488:96"/>follow ſin, and vain luſts upon the earth, and ſink into Hell and ruine at the laſt? What makes this great change, upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame truth, is it not Gods Spirit? The ſame truth, hath no life at one time, no effect upon the ſoul: At another, Oh! the moſt precious truth in the world! the Soul would not part with ſuch a truth, ſuch a promiſe, for all the world, when the ſpirit ſets it home upon the heart. Thus 'tis in reading, we ſometimes reap much benefit, from that portion of the Word, when God ſets it home, which we often read before in the Bible, and found no comfort from it, took no notice of it at all.</p>
               <p>§ 12. Quer. 6. <hi>What makes the ſame paſſages, delivered at the ſame time, to men of the ſame profeſſion, temper, and opinion, produce differenteffects?</hi> That the one is affected, the other not, the one trembles, the other not, the one is converted by it, the other not. The Word is the ſame, and the parties ſuppoſed the ſame, as to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, education, profeſſion, and the like. Yet the Spirit works on the one, and not on the other, and that makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>§ 13. Quer. 7. <hi>What makes men of the ſame age, living under the ſame powerful
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49488:97"/>miniſtry, to bee converted, and brought home at divers years diſtance?</hi> Is it not becauſe the Spirit, ſets home the Word betimes, on ſome, and not on other mens ſouls? Converſion, when ever it is wrought, is the irreſiſtible work of the Spirit of Grace, it is the gift of God, when ever effected.

               <p>§ 14. Quer. 8. <hi>What makes the ſame truths, working converſion in diverſe perſons, work not one, and the ſame way?</hi> But in one it cauſes many terrours, and in another ſweet Goſpel meltings of Soul, and both by it, are brought home to Chriſt. It is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee reſolved into the Spirits arbitrary working upon the ſoul, in order to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Conviction of ſin, is neceſſary to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans converſion, but terrours are not. The ſpirit works the former, more or leſſe, in all; But the terrours of conſcience, and ratlings of the chains of Hell, are not alike in all. And the ſame ſpirit, may uſe the ſame truths, in a different manner, to bring home diverſe ſouls to God. Great ſinners have oftentimes the greateſt terrors. Yet the ſpirit of God, may uſe the ſame Goſpel truths, to bring home ſome to God,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49488:97"/>by ſtrong terrours, and others by a Goſpel ſweetneſſe, and pouring in much comfort, at firſt converſion.</p>
               <p>§ 15. Qu. 9. <hi>What makes the Goſpel Preached, to bee a ſavour of life, unto ſome, and a ſavour of death to others, in the ſame Congregation, perhaps in the ſame ſeat?</hi> 'Tis becauſe ſome are left to the hardneſſe of their own hearts, and the Spirit comes powerfully with the Word unto the hearts of others. In a plain and powerful Sermon, Chriſt ſtands at the door, and knocks at the hearts of all, that hear it in a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now the Spirit, that hath the Key of mens hearts in his hands; opens ſome, and lets others alone, lockt faſt up, in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and unbeleef. Thus God opened the hearts of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and the <hi>Jaylour:</hi> And others again, go to Hell unconverted, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps unconvinced, from under powerful Preaching. Of whom I ſay, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid,</hi>

               <p>§ 16. Qu. 10. <hi>What makes diverſe truths ſet home upon diverſe men, produce one and the ſame effect?</hi> Is it not from the Spirit of God, that different truths ſhould bee ſet home, in order to Converſion? If in the Word onely, why not the ſame portion of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49488:98"/>it, alwaies a means of converſion; But wee ſee one place, for one, and another place, for the converſion of another.<note place="margin">Fr. Junii vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>How does the Spirit of God, teach in the Word?</hi>

               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:49488:99"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe five ſeveral waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Removendo,</hi> by removing of Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Before the Spirit of God, doth fully diſpatch his work, hee removes all hinderances and impediments out of the way. Though the Spirit of God be not the natural Agent, yet herein hee much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles them. They remove hinderances, ere they finiſh their work, or can effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compleat it. The fire burns not till the moiſture be conſumed: The Sun enlightens not, till the darkneſs be expelled. Thus the Spirit works not fully on the ſoul, to teach it, till the hinderances of our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be removed. Four Impediments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
               <p>§ 2. 1. An <hi>unwillingneſs to be taught. Job</hi> layeth down the character of a wicked man. <hi>Therefore they ſay unto God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 21.14</note> 
                  <hi>depart from us, for wee deſire not the knowledge of thy waies.</hi> Obſerve here the particle <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;</hi> it refers to the fore-going verſe.<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>They ſpend their daies in wealth,</hi> or <hi>mirth,</hi> the word denotes both, or whatſoever may be deemed,<note place="margin">Bonum ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aundum.</note> 
                  <hi>A pleaſing good thing. Therefore</hi> they ſay unto God, depart from us. Oh 'tis wealth, and worldly proſperity, and carnal jollity, that make many ſo unwilling to be acquainted with God, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49488:99"/>of his waies, that is, of thoſe waies, that God would have them to walk in. They are willing to be rich, but unwilling to be holy. They are forward, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain jovial mirth, but loath to give way to real ſorrow for ſin. If they have but the bleſſings of Gods left hand, they care not for the mercies of his right hand. Gain is is their Godlineſs, and Gold is their God. But ſay they, wee care not for <hi>thee,</hi> wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not the knowledge of <hi>thy</hi> waies.<note place="margin">Mercerus in Locum.</note> God here rips open the hearts of wicked men; <hi>They ſay,</hi> that is, as the <hi>Pſalmiſts Fool</hi> did, <hi>in his heart,</hi> there is no God. Few ſo groſly prophane, as to ſay this openly, that they care not for ſaving knowledge; yea but this is in their hearts, they are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be taught; <hi>They love folly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 1.2</note> 
                  <hi>and hate knowledge.</hi> Now this is that the Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves, as a great hinderance of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. What Maſter can do good on any Scholar, that is wholly averſe to his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, unwilling to be taught, yea that plainly hates learning? Thus there is no good at all to be done, on ſuch who are wholly unwilling to learn ſaving Truths. There is the cure. <hi>Behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 1.23</note> 
                  <hi>I will make known my words.</hi> 'Tis the Spirit of God, muſt remove
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49488:100"/>our unwillingneſs to be taught, or elſe wee ſhall ſtill be block-heads, and dunces, in the School of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Pſa. 110.3</note> 
                  <hi>Thy People ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the day of thy Power.</hi> Till Chriſt ſend out his Spirit to prepare ſubjects for him, they will not come unto Chriſt, that they may be ſaved.</p>
               <p>§ 3. 2 Impediment, <hi>Fleſhly luſts.</hi> Theſe <hi>Barracado</hi> the Spirit of God, out of the ſoul. The Spirit of God, takes no liking, or pleaſure, in ſuch impure houſes. <hi>Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt ad candida tect a columbae,</hi> Doves come chearfully, to white and clean houſes. The Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Ephoſ. 4.18, 19</note> the <hi>Dove of the Goſpel,</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates impure, unclean, and unchaſte ſouls. In <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. Wee read of thoſe <hi>that are darkened in their underſtandings. Verſ.</hi> 19. gives the reaſon. <hi>They gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to laſcivionſneſs, to work all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi> The loſs of God at firſt in Paradiſe, left all men in a ſtate of Ignorance and Darkneſs: but our fleſhly luſts and corruptions, make us have an hard heart, and a ſeared conſcience, and keeps us from renewing our acquaintance with God. The natural man knoweth not the things of God. 'Tis true of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural unregenerate man, but moſt clear in thoſe, that are devoted to the worſt ſort of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49488:100"/>carnality, to fleſhly luſts. The Spirit of God removes this Impediment.</p>
               <p>§ 4. 3 Impediment, is <hi>Pride.</hi> Ignorance and Pride, ordinarily go together. Though few are ſo ſottiſh, as to be proud of their ignorance, yet uſually ignorant people have ſo much of pride, as to keep out the means of ſaving knowledge. It is ordinary for much natural knowledge to be there, where there is not a dram of ſaving grace. Now knowledge, without grace makes men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh proud; this was the very ſin of the Devils. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.1</note> Now the Spirit of God muſt make us humble, ere wee ſhall be taught by him. A proud Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſeems to be a contradiction, when as all things in Chriſtianity adminiſters mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our humility. So that the Spirit, muſt firſt remove our Pride, ere hee will make us Chriſtians indeed.</p>
               <p>§ 5. 4 Impediment, is <hi>Curioſity.</hi> Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inquirers, have alwaies layn under the laſh of Chriſt. Upon all emergencies, he takes occaſion ſeverely to condemn them. <hi>Peter</hi> is ſharply taken up for this, by our Saviour, who would fain have known, what ſhould become of the beloved Diſciple <hi>John.</hi> Chriſt tells <hi>Peter; If I will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 21.22</note> 
                  <hi>that hee tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49488:101"/>thou mee.</hi> A full example and inſtance wee have of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.6, 7. All the Diſciples being together, they asked Chriſt, <hi>Lord! wilt thou at this time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 1.6, 7</note> 
                  <hi>reſtore again the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unto Iſrael?</hi> Verſ. 7. <hi>And hee ſaid unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the ſeaſons.</hi> The reaſon why our Saviour alwaies checks this humour of Curioſity, is becauſe the great indulgers of this, are moſt times neglecters of matters of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. This is plainly hinted at, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity it ſelf reproved, and condemned in that place of St. <hi>Luke.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 13.23, 24</note> One asks of Chriſt, <hi>Are there few that bee ſaved?</hi> What a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious queſtion is here? What profit; if it ſhould be known? or how could this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the inquirers ſalvation, to know punctually how few, or how many ſhall be ſaved? Our Saviour ſets him upon other work, ſecretly, yet ſharply reproves this fond curioſity; <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the strait gate.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, what is that to thee, whether few or many; here is your work, if you would be ſaved, you muſt ſtrive your ſelves, to enter in at the ſtrait gate. Bee rather conſcientious in practice, than curious in your enquiries; this is the way to bring you to Heaven. This is the moſt dangerous Engine, the Devil
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49488:101"/>uſes to undoe ſouls withall. For when the Spirit hath made ſouls willing to be taught, and have thrown by, luſt, and pride, which made them ſlight and under value know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: And the Devil ſees they are in good earneſt for knowledge; they hear, and read Scriptures to get knowledge; then hee ſtrives to turn them to vain inquiries, and curious ſpeculations, that ſo, if they will be knowing, hee may keep them buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout unprofitable curioſities, contrary to the ſaving knowledge, taught by the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>§ 6. Five waies Satan promotes Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, to prevent ſaving knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By putting us upon inquiring after thoſe things, which God hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. It might prevent many miſcarriages in inquiſitive curious minds, if they had often ſuch handſome jerks, as St. <hi>Auſt in</hi> gave him, that would needs know what God was doing of before hee created the World; hee told him, hee was making Hell for ſuch curious inquirers into Gods ſecrets. <hi>Secret things belong to God, yet the ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him.</hi> Labour to fear God, and all thoſe ſecrets that are for our advantage, ſhall be known. It's the greateſt folly in the world, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49488:102"/>to be wiſe beyond Gods revealed will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By making us induſtrious to inquire after thoſe things that nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us. As when any are buſying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the Apoſtaſie of the Angels, and ſearching after reaſons of the irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verableneſs of their fall, and in the mean while neglect ſalvation offered by Chriſt, for their own loſt and undone ſouls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By putting us upon the ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the knowledge of things leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. As when one ſhould devote, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſe himſelf wholly in the ſearching into the circumſtances of Worſhip, and the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Church, and in the mean while, neglect the ſtudying the very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By putting us upon ſtudying the more difficult places of Scripture, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting thoſe that are moſt for edification. When one reads the <hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> more than his plain Epiſtles. The Devil knows hee is no loſer, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſoul but a little gainer, if hee can but perſwade him to be alwaies poring upon <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſies, with a neglect of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms. If hee can but put him upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling difficult Scriptures, and neglect
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49488:102"/>mortifying unruly luſts, and the quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his affections by the plaineſt Truths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By making ſouls not to reſt barely in Gods revealed Will, without a reaſon of it, and for it. How far this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity-hath driven thoſe of the <hi>Socinian</hi> perſwaſion, may eaſily be ſeen, by thoſe many groſs opinions, that are extant in their writings, which make many for-bear to own them as Chriſtians. It is a very groſs failing in the ſtudying of things of God, to bring all things down to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of humane reaſon. There is reaſon for us to beleeve it, if God ſayes it, and to practiſe any thing if wee are aſſured that God commands it. And yet Chriſtianity is ſo far from ſtripping men of their reaſon, that no Profeſſion doth put any upon ſo true an uſe of it, and doth ſo ennoble the rational faculties of man, as the Chriſtian Religion doth. The Spirit of God in teaching ſouls effectually the things of God for their ſalvation, removes this groſs impediment of a curious mind, and makes plain, neceſſary, and moſt edifying Truths, to be moſt acceptable.</p>
               <p>§ 7. II. <hi>Suggerendo.</hi> The Spirit teacheth the Soul by ſuggeſting Goſpel Truths unto the ſoul. When the Spirit of God, teaches any
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49488:103"/>in order to make them new men, it brings new Truths into the minds of men. All Old things are done away, and all things become new. Theſe are called <hi>new Truths</hi> in regard of the ſubject receiving of them, not in regard of the Spirits ſuggeſting of them, for the ſame Truths are alwaies taught by the Spirit now, as were formerly, nor in oppoſition to the Word, for ſo they are not new Truths, but ſuch, as of old were revealed and declared in the Word. The very office of the Spirit in ſuggeſting Truths is reſtrained by Chriſt himſelf, to thoſe Truths which our Saviour had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught us; I ſhall ſhew further from <hi>John</hi> 14.26. § 11. There may be new ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit, in ſetting home Divine Truths upon the mind, and theſe are really <hi>new,</hi> to the ſoul that receives them, but they are old Truths of the Word, and not <hi>new Revelations,</hi> that the Spirit teaches to beleeving ſouls, and in this ſenſe we are to underſtand thoſe Scriptures, which ſpeak of the teaching of the Spirit of God. — <hi>Yee need not that any man teach you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 2.27.</note> 
                  <hi>but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is Truth.</hi> — Not that we need not a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but he ſpeaks <hi>comparatively,</hi> you ſhall not be ſo helped by any inſtructions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49488:103"/>the Spirit, as with the Spirit. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall declare the Truth as it is in Jeſus.

Out of Chriſt, the higheſt light, is meer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. There is no true light, that leads to ſalvation, but what comes from Chriſt the Sun of Righteouſneſſe.

If Chriſts as God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens every man that comes into the world, with the light of reaſon, yet we muſt not therefore beleeve, that Chriſt enlightens every one by ſaving Grace, as he is Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Every man in the world, hath an <hi>inward light</hi> of nature, or light of reaſon, call'd in Scripture,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.27.</note> 
                  <hi>the candle of the Lord.</hi> According to which, every man hath ſome ſeeds of the knowledge of good and evil. This is the light of mans <hi>natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Every true Saint, one that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated truly, by the Word, and Spirit,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49488:105"/>hath an <hi>inward light</hi> of the Spirit, the light of Grace. This is <hi>light in the Lord.</hi> According to this,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.8.</note> a Saint hath his <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſavingly enlightned.</hi> This light is not onely <hi>uſeful,</hi> but <hi>neceſſary,</hi> to all true Chriſtians, in their life here <hi>as Christians,</hi> and will bring them to Heaven at the laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a middle light, betwixt the light of Nature, and the ſaving light of Grace, that is the common work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, called <hi>illumination</hi> too, which many in the viſible Church do enjoy, and yet are reprobates. According to this,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.6.</note> men may have an <hi>awakened conſcience.</hi> This light may bee uſeful to others, but it will not advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage a wicked man at all, if hee go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than this common work.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> No man that receives inward ſaving light of the Spirit, but was firſt in great ſpiritual darkeneſſe. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Epheſians. Ye were ſometimes darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but now are yee light in the Lord.</hi>

And our Saviour was much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, in ſending <hi>Paul</hi> to open mens eyes, and to turn them <hi>from darkeneſſe to light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 26.18</note> by preaching of the Goſpel, if ſo be they had
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49488:106"/>this Light by Nature.

                  </note> Let others therefore, ſit down and embrace that ſo much admired <hi>Darling,</hi> of an <hi>Inward Natural, yet ſaving Light in all;</hi> wee know 'tis but a <hi>Changeling,</hi> and not the genuine off-ſpring of the Spirit of God. Much like that <hi>Strumpet-Goddeſſe</hi> of the men of <hi>Epheſus; Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> But in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Language, it proved a great cry about <hi>nothing.</hi> For, ſaies hee, <hi>Wee know that an Idoll is nothing.</hi>

               <p>§ 10. IV. The Spirit of God teaches <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborando,</hi> by ſtrengthening the mind and underſtanding. The mind of man is full of weakneſs, as well as darkneſs. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, in his teaching, brings not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light, but alſo ſtrength to the ſouls of Gods Children, <hi>Paul</hi> prayes, <hi>that they may be strengthened,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>with might, by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the inward man.</hi> The inward man, the ſoul of a Saint, is the chief object of the Spirits care. For the outward man, that is many times weak and vile, but the Spirit, comes by his teaching to renew, and ſtreng-then the inward man, that though the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man decay, yet the inward man may be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49488:106"/>renewed, ſtrengthened, and confirmed day by day. And if any ſhall enquire how God by his Spirit, doth ſtrengthen the minds of his Children.<note place="margin">Fr. Junius de Th. ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. c. <hi>12.</hi> p. <hi>1403.</hi> T. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> A learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Divine, gives this ſolid ſatisfaction, to his inquiry. <q>Whatſoever power is implanted in man by nature, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that God by the power of his Spirit doth ſo poſſeſs, that to thoſe gifts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hee conjoyns the gifts of his grace, that are anſwerable to them. For to the <hi>Principles</hi> that are naturally placed in the underſtanding, hee ſuper-adds, the <hi>Principles of Grace:</hi> To <hi>Reaſon</hi> that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes out of thoſe Principles hee conjoyns the <hi>increaſe of his Divine Light.</hi> To the <hi>Concluſions</hi> and <hi>Determinations,</hi> which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath attained to by the moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect light of nature, hee ſuper-adds ſupernatural and moſt perfect <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,</hi> out of which heavenly <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> may be raiſed in the minds of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. To conclude, hee propounds heavenly objects, to be apprehended, by the mind and will, after an heavenly manner, and alſo raiſes the will to the apprehenſion of thoſe objects that are propounded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ 11. V. And laſtly, <hi>Recolligendo.</hi> The
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49488:107"/>Spirit teaches by raiſing and recollecting fallen Truths. Mans memory is very ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, eſpecially as to Divine Truths, very apt to let them ſlip, and leak thorow. <hi>Therefore wee ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that wee have heard, leſt at any time wee ſhould let them ſlip.</hi>

                  </gap>, leſt wee let them run out, as leaking Veſſels are wont to do. Or the Metaphor may be taken from Paper that lets letters ſink in, and the Ink run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that they cannot be diſtinctly read. Thus Divine Truths, either leak out, or run abroad, that they prove uſeleſs to ſouls at the greateſt need. Now the Spirit recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and brings in Divine Truths, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſions, as may be moſt for the ſouls advantage. <hi>Hee ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, what-ever I have ſaid to you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 14.26</note> Here is one admirable advantage of Gods teaching by his Spirit, that when the Word comes onely to the outward ear in hearing, yet Gods Spirit can ſet it home afterwards, and make it effectual for comfort, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, or quickening, as his Children want it. The Apoſtles heard our Saviour himſelf preach, yet our Saviours words, without his Spirit, would work no comfort or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49488:107"/>to their ſouls. Again, the Spirit ſhall teach, and be their remembrancer, yet obſerve it, our Saviour ſticks cloſe to the Word, <hi>Whatſoever I have ſaid unto you,</hi>

               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What are the qualifications of the Spirits teaching?</hi> The full anſwer to this I ſhall give in, in theſe <hi>ſeven</hi> following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:49488:108"/>1. The Spirit teaches <hi>fully.</hi> Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit never teaches fouls that hee undertakes, with half teaching. Hee does not make men to be almoſt onely, but altogether Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Should the Spirit of God open one eye onely, and leave the other blinde, the Devil would have great advantage, hee would alwaies ſtrike men on the blinde ſide. Now the Spirit of God teaches all fully, as to neceſſary Truths for ſalvation. There is no one Truth, the Devil can tell a Childe of God, hee is ſo wholly ignorant of, that the ignorance of it will cauſe his eternal damnation. This is the great work of the Spirit of God, to make the ſoul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the deep things of God, which are kept hid from the world, and worldly men.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9, 10, 11, 12</note> None but the Spirit of God is fully acquainted with thoſe Truths, that concerns our ſalvation, and therefore the Spirit alone can fully diſcover them to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>§ 2.2. The Spirit of God teaches <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly.</hi> Matters of Divine ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, carry much of a ſecret pleaſure with them. No ſuch real and ſolid pleaſure in all the world, as that which a gracious ſoul findes, in the experimental diſcoveries of Goſpel-Truths. 'Tis ſenſual and ſwiniſh
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49488:108"/>pleaſure, which men take in following ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful waies. But the onely ſolid pleaſure is in Divine Experiences. It is a pleaſure worthy a rational ſoul, to be raviſhed with the love of Chriſt, and to be enamoured with that commanding beauty that the waies of holineſs do afford. A tincture of pleaſure carries the ſoul far in its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Men would never run on headlong in waies of wickedneſs, were not pleaſures laid as the bait to allure them. Now what is it makes many ſouls to quit their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in this life, their friends, their eſtates, their liberties, yea their lives themſelves, rather than part with thoſe Truths the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath taught them? Onely this, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a greater pleaſure in owning them, and ſticking cloſe to them, than in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in the World. What makes Duties and Ordinances, irkſome and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to carnal hearts, but delightful to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls? 'Tis the pleaſure the Spirit gives in, to the one, and not to the other, that makes the difference. A man may know much of the ſpirituality of his heart towards God, and that hee is under the teachings of Gods Spirit, by that pleaſure, and delight, and content hee takes in the Ordinances of God. Gracious ſouls cry,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49488:109"/>oh let us go up into the houſe of God, when will Sabbaths, and Sermons, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come, that our ſouls may be refreſhed with them. But worldly minded men cry out as they did, when will the Sabbaths and New Moons be over? when will Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Prayers, and Reading be done? Alas! they take no pleaſure at all, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and therefore care not whether they enjoy theſe mercies or no; or if out of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality they wait upon the Ordinances, they care not how ſoon they are done. Cuſtome carries ſinners upon duties, conſcience puts the Saints upon them. Formality and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie makes the one, true delight and pleaſure makes the other, go thorow with them. <hi>Moſes,</hi> when hee came out of the Mount from God, his face did ſhine. Thus, when gracious ſouls come from Goſpel-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their hearts ſhine, they are filled with unſpeakable joy and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>§ 3.3. The Spirit teaches <hi>clearly.</hi> Chriſt ſpake while hee was upon the earth in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, and proverbs, but after his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Spirit was poured out,<note place="margin">Job. 16.25</note> hee then teaches plainly, and clearly. Spiritual teaching is the plaineſt and cleareſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world. According to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Lights, there is a great difference of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49488:109"/>ſight, in point of clearneſſe. One man ſees an object by the Moon-light, another by a Candle-light, but hee ſees moſt clearly, that takes a view of his object by the light of the Sun, when it is riding in its noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day glory.</p>
               <p>A true Chriſtian ſees divine things not onely by the dimme light of nature, nor meerly by the light of the Word, but by the bright, and clear light of the Spirit, which manifeſts things to the ſoul. A clear light diſcovers all, even the ſmalleſt objects which otherwiſe would not be ſeen: So doth the Spirit of God diſcover thoſe Truths, and Divine Myſteries to a beleevers ſoul, without whoſe light they would be wholly undiſcerned. The words of our Saviour in the fore-cited place are very remarkable. <hi>The time cometh when I ſhall no more ſpeak to you in proverbs, but I ſhall ſhew you</hi> plainly <hi>of the Father.</hi>

                  </gap>. All things by the Spirit are manifeſted, even the moſt hidden things of God. Three things go to a clear diſcerning, the <hi>Object,</hi> the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty</hi> that is ſtated in the eye, and the <hi>Medium,</hi> or mean thorow which wee ſee, all muſt be clear, and then there is a clear
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49488:110"/>diſcovery made. Thus the Holy Spirit plainly reveals the counſels of God in the Word; there's the <hi>Object,</hi> then opens the <hi>Judgement</hi> to diſcern it, then clears all the <hi>Mediums,</hi> the <hi>Means</hi> for conveyance of thoſe objects to us. And becauſe a <hi>due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> is required in ſpiritual, as well as bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſeeing, the Spirit brings Divine Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects home to the ſoul in particular, and ſo they are the plainer and clearer to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Thus the Spirit of God is a clear inſtructor, no man need be taught more clearly.</p>
               <p>§ 4.4. The Spirit teaches <hi>ſeaſonably.</hi> The wiſdome and goodneſs of the Spirit of God, is much diſcerned in his ſeaſonable teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſouls. To ſpeak in ſeaſon, is an high peece of wiſdome; words ſpoken in ſeaſon, <hi>are like Apples of Gold in pictures of Silver.</hi> His goodneſs appears too, in that hee helps, when there is moſt need. How ſuitable is a refreſhing promiſe in the time of deſertion, a word of comfort, in the time of affliction, a word of eſtabliſhment in the time of tentation? And even thus ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably is Gods Spirit wont to apply himſelf unto ſouls. Sometimes the Spirit of God directs the Preacher from his Text, to ſend ſome ſeaſonable Truth home to a ſoul. As
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49488:110"/>I have read of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as hee was preaching, hee was ſuddenly carried from his Text, hee knew not how, to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Manichees.</hi> A little after one meets him, and thanks him for that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his, it was a means of reclaiming him from thoſe errors hee was preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. And it hath been the experience of ſome good men, that thoſe Truths that have been ſuggeſted to them in preaching, beyond their ordinary meditation, have had ſome good effect; and they have heard ſouls to be more affected with thoſe, than with other Truths delivered at the ſame time. A digreſſion in a Sermon, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, proves a diverſion in ſome mens thoughts, which may help forward the converſion of ſome ſoul or other in the Auditory. I have ſometimes thought, thoſe affectionate <hi>Parentheſes,</hi> of the Spirits ſuggeſting in preaching of Sermons (well digeſted otherwiſe before-hand) are much like that moſt exquiſite ſtory of the woman, that had a bloody iſſue, whoſe Faith made her whole, that is inſerted in the paſſage of <hi>Jairus,</hi> his Daughter being healed of our Saviour.<note place="margin">Luke 8.41</note> The Evangeliſt ſets down the beginning of that paſſage about <hi>Jairus</hi> the Ruler of the Synagogue; as our
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49488:111"/>Saviour was going to cure his Daughter, the woman meets him in the way, and hee cures her firſt, and then raiſes <hi>Jairus</hi> his Daughter that was dead. Thus the Spirit of God doth ſometimes direct the Miniſter, to ſuch a ſubject, that may raiſe a dead ſoul, that may quicken dead affections, but by the way, hee meets with a ſoul that hath a bloody Iſſue of ſin, ſome reigning luſts or other; here may be ſome Truths ſeaſonably ſuggeſted to cure his ſoul, and then hee is directed forward to raiſe and quicken thoſe that may be overtaken with deadneſs, and dulneſs. This occaſional, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential diſcovery of Truths, that come cloſe to the ſoul that receives them, ſpeaks very much the ſeaſonable teachings of the Spirit of God. As ſome by an occaſional reading of ſuch a place of Scripture, or ſuch an ones writings, or ſuch an one they have perhaps heard occaſionally preach, and ſuch Truths have dropped into the ſoul, ſo ſuitably, as if God had immediately ſpoken from Heaven; this muſt be reſolved into the work of Gods Spirit, that directs all for the beſt advantage of Gods Children.</p>
               <p>§ 5. 5. The Spirit of God teaches <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly.</hi> A Childe of God is not lead by meer conjectures about the things of God
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49488:111"/>that hee is taught. The higheſt the Saints can ariſe to ordinarily, is but a conjectural probability, according to the Papiſts, ſo that they may give ſome probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures at their good eſtate. But the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, where it comes and teaches, leaves not the ſoul at ſuch uncertainties. How could St. <hi>Paul</hi> have bid the <hi>Corinthians examine themſelves whether were in the Faith or no,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13 5</note> unleſs they could have known this certainly?

Thus Gods Spirit works in a moſt certain kind of way in the Soul, that few or none, but do, or at leaſt may know it if they are careful.

The Spirit of God teaches profitably, in that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He teaches <hi>practically.</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in his teaching directs ſouls to happineſs,

                  <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are yee if yee do them.</hi> If the Spirit ſhould teach us knowledge without practice, he would leave us lame, if pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice without knowledge, hee would leave us blind, but teaching profitably he teaches both, that leads us unto happineſs. There are many obſtructions 'twixt the head and the heart, which hinder our knowledg from having a kindly influence upon practice, which the Spirit by his teaching doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. So that what enters into the head in the notion, comes down to the heart for operation. True Chriſtians are of another make, than to reſemble the Toad, which hath a Pearl in the head, but the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy full of poyſon. They have not the Pearl of knowledge onely, but the Jewel of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice alſo, and this makes them truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in Gods eyes. Alas! what will all the notions in the world do good, for the mortifying our ſins, and cleanſing the ſoul from ſinful affections, without practice? If wee have a receipt onely for a diſeaſe that troubles us, and not take the phyſick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, wee may languiſh away by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the diſeaſe, bee the receipt never

               <p>§ 7 <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Spirit teaches profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, in that hee teaches <hi>particularly.</hi> Gods Spirit teaches a true Chriſtian to apply all that he hears and reads unto himſelf. Hee thinks the Commands belongs to him, the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49488:114"/>Threatnings to him, and all that is written, or preached, that ſpeaks matter of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or reformation, that he is concerned in it, hee ſees all concerns his ſouls wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, as if it had been written on very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for him, Obſerve here the carriage of ungodly hearts: When they hear particular ſins reproved, they put it off to others, ſuch an one (ſay they) had his leſſon to day, hee was met withal in ſuch a Sermon, and by ſuch expreſſions. Well, but a true Chriſtian, in any ſuch cloſe expreſſions that meet with the conſcience, is taught by the Spirit to ſay, <hi>Numquid ego talis?</hi> Am not I the man? Is not this my ſin? Is it not my very caſe? He hears hypocriſie condemned in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſervice of God: Well, am not I che Hypocrite that is laſhed by thoſe cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reproofs? Hee hears a Chriſtian may obtain aſſurance, young men may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, Have I had theſe things or no? Am not I far ſhort from what a true Chriſtian may bee, and ought to bee? Thus ungodly men reſt onely in the generals, but the true Chriſtian brings the generals down to his particular caſe, well knowing that <hi>Dolus latet in univerſalibus.</hi> That groſſeſt ſoul-deceit lyes in reſting only in univerſals.</p>

               <p>§ 8. 7. The Spirit of God teaches ſouls <hi>Gradually.</hi> God deals with particular ſouls as hee hath done with the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, clears up truth by degrees. The Church at firſt, and when loweſt, had truth enough diſcovered to conſtitute it a true Church, but by degrees, little and little, truths in particular were made more clear.<note place="margin">Iſ.

                  </note> Thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoul, when hee becomes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, taught of God, hath neceſſary truths for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation made known: So that ſuppoſe him to dye preſently after converſion, hee hath knowledge enough to carry him to Heaven; But the longer hee lives, the more he grows, an increaſe is made in his Grace, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as well as in the reſt of his Graces. Wee have no foundation for ſuch gradual teaching, as to expect the Spirit ſhould teach more truths afterwards, than are written in the Word of God. No, but that which I ſpeak of is, that the Spirit clears up the ſame truths with greater evidence of light, then the Soul had before, if they were truths abſolutely neceſſary; And as for other truths which contribute to the <hi>well being</hi> and not abſolutely to the <hi>being</hi> of a true Chriſtian, the Spirit teaches theſe by degrees, ſome after others, none of which perhaps were known to the ſoul at firſt converſion.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:49488:115"/>
               <p>But ſtill in revealing New Truths to the ſoul, the Spirit doth not add New Truths to the Word, but ſets home the <hi>Old Truths,</hi> with <hi>New Lights.

For the pretence of the Spirit, in its dictates of Truths, beſides, and above the Word, will fetch Arguments from the ſame Spirit to maintain them (though the groſſeſt deluſions) and ſo the Word, and all ordinary means of reducing ſuch ſouls to their right wits again, become wholly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and unprofitable.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49488:117"/>Some few that are moſt material, and moſt ſubſervient to the deſign of this Treatiſe, I ſhall propound and proſecute in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the whole.</p>
               <p n="1">I. If God be preſent to teach his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by his Spirit. If wee would know then whether wee are the Children of God, let us <hi>examine</hi> and try whether wee are taught by the Spirit or no. There is an eaſie way for our being deceived herein; Natural parts may carry men far in the knowledge of the things of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon illumination of the Spirit may carry us much further, and yet all this while wee may come far ſhort from the ſaving teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God. 'Tis worth while then to examine our ſelves by ſuch Rules as may clearly undeceive us, in a matter of ſo great concernment.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Rule 1. <hi>That Knowledge of Divine Truths that drives us off from God, comes not from the teachings of the Spirit.</hi> The very end, and main deſign of the Spirits teaching, is to bring us home to God and Chriſt. Now if any Truth drives us off from God, how can this come from the Spirits teaching? Conviction of ſin, and ſelf-abhorrency under it, may and uſually do come from the Spirit of God, but then
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49488:118"/>theſe drive the ſoul to God for the pardon of ſin. <hi>And when the Spirit is come, he ſhall convince the world of Sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 16.8</note> 
                  <hi>and of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> When the Spirit ſets home ſin upon the ſoul, in order to converſion, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee alſo clearly diſcovers the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, for the removal of it. But when ſin is diſcovered, ſo as to drive us to deſpair, or to tempt us to preſume upon Gods mercy, without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, that the Juſtice of God alſo muſt be ſatisfied; this is no teaching of the Spirit. Coming unto God, in a way God never owned, nor preſcribed, is a direct running away from him. So that though wee come to God, to preſume upon his mercy, wee do in reality run away from him, becauſe God cannot ſhew mercy, to the eternal diſhonour and ruine of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Mercy cannot be exerted on poor ſinners, till the breaches of Gods honour are repaired, and his Juſtice ſatisfied. Coming to God by Faith through Chriſt, makes way for both, and then both Mercy and Juſtice ſhall triumph and rejoyce toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the ſalvation of rebellious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Rule 2. <hi>Hee that pretends to much new knowledge, and yet continues in his old
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49488:118"/>ſins, is not taught by the Spirit of God.</hi> To pretend to the Spirit, and live in the fleſh is double iniquity. <hi>Simulata ſanctitas eſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex iniquitas.</hi> The Law of the Spirit frees the ſoul from the Law of ſin and death.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2 Verſ. 5.</note> They that are after the Spirit, mind the things of the Spirit; read 6, 7, 8, 9. verſes. Gods Spirit teaches none to continue, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of known ſins. Hee doth not allow them to ſin, and then teach them, that <hi>that</hi> is to be ſpiritual, <hi>to deem nothing ſin, that wee poſſibly can commit.</hi> Hee doth not allow ſouls to live as they lift, and then teach them, that God ſees no ſin in his Children.

Thoſe that are made partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, have eſcaped the pollution of the world; they add to their virtue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; to their knowledge, temperance, &amp;c. The Spirit changes the garments of thoſe he takes to be his Scholars; hee throws off the raggs of their old ſins, and puts on the Robes of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and upon thoſe Robes, hee places this <hi>Golden Chain</hi> of Graces, as an Ornament to him, being under the guidance and teaching of the Spirit of God. This Chain is made up of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49488:119"/>many links, Faith, Virtue, Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godlineſs, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Kindneſs, Charity. Hee that hath all theſe, is truly knowing, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. Hee that wants theſe, is ſtark blinde, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Rule 3. <hi>Hee is taught by the Spirit that hath the ſweetneſs, and comforts of Goſpel-Truths made out ſeaſouably to the ſoul.</hi> Thus may a Chriſtian know that a promiſe is ſet home by the Spirit, when it comes in to the upholding of the ſoul, under grievances and afflictions, at preſent incumbent on the ſoul; or for the mortification of ſin, which is his great burden, and trouble of his life. Where our own ſtrength and parts fail, there the Spirit of God ordinarily comes in with a ſupply. When wee know not in what box, our evidences, our comfort, our quickening, our ſtrength lyes, then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God comes in, and opens the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to us, and ſuch places of the Word as are both ſuitable and ſeaſonable for us.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Rule 4. <hi>Hee is taught of the Spirit, that is impartial in his deſires of, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after knowledge.</hi> What-ever concerns either the Glory of God, or the welfare of his ſoul, hee labours to have that made known to him. Partiality makes men act
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49488:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>onely to have ſo much knowledge, as to have their tongues by it tipt with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when in the mean while they look not at the ordering of their lives, as becomes an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed. The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Cornelius</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> is that which well becomes a true Diſciple of Chriſt. <hi>Wee are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 10.33</note> Nay, be they never ſo bitter things, yet a gracious heart deſires to know the worſt, as well as the beſt, of himſelf; what makes moſt againſt him, as well as what makes moſt for him. As it was with <hi>Eli;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.17</note> hee urges <hi>Samuel</hi> to let him know, all that was the mind of God, be it never ſo bitter. It is contrary with carnal hearts, if any thing croſs their luſts, or go contrary to their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſigns, they care not for knowing of it. <hi>Herod</hi> caſt <hi>John</hi> into priſon, becauſe hee told him it was not lawful for him to have his Brothers Wife.<note place="margin">Mark 6.18</note> Thus ungodly hearts riſe againſt the Word, when it would part them from their ſins: and aſcribe a cloſe, and convincing Sermon, rather to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of the Teacher, than to the teaching of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>§ 6. Rule 5. <hi>Hee receives the Truths of God with much humility. Paul</hi> was deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49488:120"/>proud whilſt a Phariſee, ignorant of the ſpirituality of the Law, but very humble when hee became a ſincere Chriſtian.<note place="margin">Act. 20.19</note> 
                  <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord with all humility of mind.</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſouls, like the loweſt valleyes, are very fruitful, whilſt proud hearts, like the lofty hills, are barren and unprofitable. See the deportment of <hi>Agur; I am more bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh than any man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 0.30.2, 3</note> 
                  <hi>I have not the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man.</hi> Yet hee exhorts his Scholars to fetch their knowledge <hi>from the High One.</hi> The Holy Spirit ſeeing ſo deep a Self-denial, and Humility in him, ranks his wiſdome with <hi>Solomons,</hi> and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, and the Wiſe mans, are both joyned together.</p>
               <p>Rule 6. <hi>Hee that is taught by the Spirit, by that knowledge is carried out to purifie himſelf from ſin.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1</note> Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh, and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord. Where the Spirit teaches, purity of life is one main leſſon. The very office of the Spirit is to ſanctifie the ſoul.<note place="margin">Act. 15.9</note> Impurity of life is no Livery for the Diſciples of Chriſt to wear, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p>Rule 7. <hi>Knowledge taught by the Spirit, ſpeaks the ſoul under the influence of the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49488:120"/>Spirit, both before and after his teaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Antecedently,</hi> The Spirit puts the ſoul to <hi>pray</hi> earneſtly for his ſaving diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Goſpel-Truths. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. How much more ſhall the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask it. <hi>The Spirit</hi> here, is further diſcoveries of the Spirit. And hee that goes in the ſenſe of his darkneſs and ignorance, ſeldome comes away without an anſwer to his prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Conſequently,</hi> hee is carried out to <hi>praiſe</hi> God for the communication of ſaving knowledge, and teachings of his Spirit. Carnal hearts aſcribe all to their own parts and induſtry; Gracious ſouls own Gods Spirit in all their diſcoveries, and do deſire to improve all to his glory and praiſe.</p>
               <p>§ 7. II. Hence ariſes matter for <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;</hi> If the Spirit be preſent to teach us, wee ſhould eaſily be exhorted to own the Spirit as our grand Teacher. In that it is both our greateſt wiſdome, and chiefeſt comfort ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, It is our greateſt wiſdome.</hi> Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if wiſe, make choice of the ableſt Maſters to teach them. There is none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor abler to teach thee, than the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. Beſt of men have their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49488:121"/>in point of Knowledge, and ſo are but imperfect Teachers. But the Spirit of God, as hee is omniſcient, and knoweth all things, ſo hee is infinite, and able to teach us all things.<note place="margin">Job. 14 26</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that teacheth you all things.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to teach, is oftentimes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated in the New Teſtament, to the Articles of Faith in the Goſpel, and then the meaning is, the Spirit teacheth us all things neceſſary to ſalvation. Is it not our wiſdome now, to have an Omniſcient and Infinite Teacher? Other Teachers, though never ſo well accompliſhed, are not able to teach an Art or Science, if they meet with an unfit ſubject. A dull Scholar is many times a diſcredit, to an ingenious and very good Maſter; yet the reaſon is not becauſe the Maſter wants skill to teach. but becauſe the Scholar wants parts to learn. Now the Spirit of God, either findes, or makes men fit to be taught: If men want parts, hee enlarges the abilities of their minds; if they have natural parts, hee ſanctifies them. And indeed in this ſenſe hee findes none, but makes all fit to be taught; for none hath the leaſt degree of ſaving, and fanctifying knowledge, but what comes from the Spirits teaching.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:49488:121"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, It will bee our chiefest comfort.</hi> One dram of knowledge from the Spirit of God, goes further than a thouſand notions from natural, and meer humane teaching, in point of comfort. What comfort will the moſt knowing men have, of all their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learning, if when they come to dye they want Grace. That will bee the moſt comfortable knowledge, that a man can reflect upon, and find comfort in, when he comes to leave the world, and is juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give up his account to God. And I leave any to judge, whether the profound <hi>Schollar,</hi> the deep <hi>Polititian,</hi> the knowing <hi>Artiſt,</hi> the skilful <hi>Lawyer,</hi> the expert <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> the exact <hi>Mathematician,</hi> or the plain practical <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is like to have more comfort, in reflecting upon their knowledge at that day. The name of the Holy Spirit our teacher is alſo <hi>Comforter.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 14.26.</note> Becauſe what the Spirit teaches, advances the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians comfort, as well as informs his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>§ 8. To back the preſent exhortation fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the two motives mentioned, I ſhall ſubjoyn ſome directions, which ſhew us how wee muſt own the Spirit as our teacher.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us hear him frequently.</hi> The beſt teaching cannot come too often. The Word
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49488:122"/>of God, and Ordinances of the Goſpel, are thoſe means the Spirit teaches Souls in. Frequency in theſe is our duty, and the Spirit will teach us therein. <hi>Frequent</hi> read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word. <hi>Meditate day and night in the Law of the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.2.</note> Bee often hearing the Word Preached.<note place="margin">Pſal. 26.8</note> 
                  <hi>Lord I have loved the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of thy houſe, and the place where thine honour dwells.</hi> Men will bee there often, whither their love carries them. Gods Houſe will bee frequented, by thoſe that have any love to the Ordinances; thoſe that do not own them, ſhew they have no love to them at all.<note place="margin">Pſal 122.1</note> 
                  <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto mee, come let us go up into the houſe of the Lord.</hi> The great joy of a Chriſtian lyes in this, that hee can <hi>Frequent</hi> Gods Ordinances. Oh at what a rate would the perſecuted Chriſtians in the primitive times have purchaſed thoſe liberties of hearing, which now may bee had, yet moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably contemned? When they were forced to meet in Caves in the night to hear the Word; and would loſe their lives rather than bee deprived of the benefit of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>§ 9. 2. Let us hear the Spirits teaching <hi>diligently.</hi> It is one thing to bee bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, another to have an ear to hear the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49488:122"/>teaching. This therefore comes in often in the Goſpel. <hi>Hee that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith.</hi> Moſt men are like Idols, when they come where the Spirit teacheth, they have eyes but ſee not, ears but hear not. But, if wee would have the Spirit to bee our teacher, wee muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have that frame, that <hi>Eli</hi> put <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> into. Saying, <hi>go lye down,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.9</note> 
                  <hi>and it ſhall bee, if hee ſhall call thee, that thou ſhalt ſay, ſpeak Lord, for thy Servant heareth.</hi> Here is a Rule for us to learn to profit by, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God hath a word to ſpeak, we ſhould have an ear to hear. Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth. The more earneſt heed wee give, the more are wee like to keep up the Spirits teaching.<note place="margin">Heb. 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore wee ought to give the more earneſt heed, to the things that wee have heard leaſt at any time wee ſhould let them ſlip.</hi> Diligence and attention, are the beſt materials, to ſtop our leaking ſouls from running our.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us hear, <hi>ardently, with devotion.</hi> 'Tis the unhappineſſe of all men, to be dark by nature, and of ſome, in the midſt of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual light. The way for us to have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profitable, is to begg the Spirits teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the teaching of the Word.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Open mine eyes that I may underſtand the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49488:123"/>things of thy Law. Hebr.</hi>

                  </gap> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal mine eyes, <hi>i. e.</hi> take off the veyle of darkeneſſe and ignorance from mine eyes. Had not <hi>David, Gad,</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent teachers? Yet hee prayes to have his eyes opened by the Spirit. Where wee may obſerve, hee does begg to have his eyes opened ſo, as not to throw by the Word, and to account that, <hi>Spiritual perfection,</hi> to live either above or without the Word. But his devotion lyes here, to have enlightned eyes, to look further into Gods Law, which hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>wonderful things</hi> in it, or as the word denotes. Things that are above, and ſeparated from us, from our reaſon and underſtanding, and ſo want a better teacher, the Spirit of God to inform us. Goſpel Truths, like Gods Children, are <hi>ſeparated</hi> things: Carnal eyes can ſee but the outſide, of true Chriſtians, and carnal hearts can perceive but the external part onely of Goſpel Truths, till the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit comes to teach them.</p>
               <p>§ 10.<note place="margin">Judges 3.20.</note> 4. Let us hear him <hi>reverently, with ſubmiſſion</hi> As <hi>Eglon</hi> to <hi>Ehud</hi> when he came and told him, hee had a meſſage from God, <hi>Eglon</hi> in reverence to that, riſes off his ſeat. When God ſpeaks in anger, hee can make
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49488:123"/>the Heavens and Earth to tremble with fear; And if hee ſpeak by his Spirit to our ſouls, in mercy and love, wee ſhould trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble too, with reverential affection, and a Filial fear. Great <hi>Doctors</hi> do command re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence from their inferiour Schollars: How would <hi>Solomon</hi> with his wiſdome bee reverenced by us? but behold a greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> is here. Here is the Spirit, that is wiſdome it ſelf, to teach ſouls the way to Heaven. <hi>Solomons</hi> teaching is but the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man, but this is the teaching of God himſelf; which calls for our reverence and ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us hear him <hi>obediently with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to practiſe.</hi> To hear the Spirit teach, and not to Practice, is the next way to loſe the benefit of ſo good a Maſter. If the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit kindle a ſpark within us, wee ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get it up to a perfect flame. Quenching of the Spirit either in our ſelves or others, is no work for a Chriſtian to put in practiſe. Quench-coals as to the Spirits teaching, are the Devils Granadoes, he throws into the world to do miſchief with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Theſe are the devils plots to blow up men without fire, to undo men by extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the fire of the Spirit within. Bee not hearers onely, but doers alſo of the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49488:124"/>Word: Otherwiſe yee deceive your ſelves. It is the groſſeſt ſelf-deceit,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.22.</note> becauſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceit, to reſt barely in hearing, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without doing. Hee that knows his Maſters will and does it not, ſhall be be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with many ſtripes. Either obey what ye know is commanded, and practiſe what ye hear, or elſe better never to know or hear at all.</p>
               <p>§ 11. III. From Gods Preſence and teaching of his Spirit, there ariſes matter of reproof to three ſorts of perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſuch as depend onely upon the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit, without the Word of God.</hi> If there be any deluſions, in the world, wee muſt own this as the <hi>Belzebub</hi> amongſt them. This is the maſter plot the Devil hath uſed in the late times, to lay Goſpel Ordinances under the brand of ignominy, and groſſeſt contempt. Oh it's an eaſy way to be ſpiritual, to ſay the Spirit teaches, and then wee can condemn all for carnal, that ſtick to Ordinances, and call theſe outward forms, beggarly elements. Inſtead of <hi>Davids</hi> language, <hi>Oh when ſhall wee come up into the houſe of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 122.1.</note> wee may hear, when ſhall wee meet in ſome obſcure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or other.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note> And inſtead of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, <hi>How beautiful are the feet of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49488:124"/>thoſe that Preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tydings of good things!</hi> Wee may hear, how excellent a thing is it to hear no Miniſters at all, but to ſit ſtill in ſilence, and to expect heavenly raptures.<note place="margin">Quakers.</note> To meet together, to ſit in an amazed poſture, as if all were poſſeſſed with a <hi>dumb Devil.</hi> To this end, that which was ſpoken about a temporal deliverance, I have known, and heard uſed to defend this practiſe, <hi>viz. Stand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> And this uttered by one, who was ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently abſurd, as to avouch, more good to bee gotten by ſuch dumb and ſilent meetings, than by hearing thoſe who were Ordained Miniſters. But, muſt wee not needs look upon ſuch practiſes, as groſſe deluſions, when wee have neither <hi>precept, precedent,</hi> nor <hi>promiſe</hi> in all the Word of God to give any countenance to them? It is an endleſſe deluſion, and groſly uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the very foundation, that ſuch give themſelves up unto, that wait for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits teaching, without the Word. For what rule have I to try the Spirit by, but by the Word revealed, and written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? When as Chriſt ſayes, ſearch the Scriptures. And St. <hi>John,</hi> try the Spirits whether they are of God or no. But how
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49488:125"/>ſhall I know whether I am taught of the Spirit,<note place="margin">See before c. 13. ſſ. 8.</note> or no, unleſs the Word direct mee? As for thoſe that are deluded out of Gods way, into this endleſs path of errour. I look upon their caſe as ſad and miſerable, and yet it calls for the prayers of all their friends, relations, and acquaintance; yea and in this reſpect their condition is much the more to be pittied, in that their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy in errour, puts them upon reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as by my ſelf ſometimes hath been heard) even the benefit of others prayers for them. Mee thinks it might ſtartle any ſober-minded Chriſtian to conſider, that thoſe glorious <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that ſubmitted their necks to the block, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the flames, yet never ſuffered for any of thoſe things, which theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately maintain, who have fallen from hearing the Word, and have left the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which wee have good ground from the Word of God to brand, as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and groſs deluſions. And they that fill the world with ſo great a dinne of their purity, perfection, and ſanctity of life, when they are ſearched to the bottome, it amounts to no more than a ſenſeleſneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin, or at the beſt, but a freedome from ſome groſs and ſcandalous ſins of the world.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:49488:125"/>
               <p>§ 12. 2 Reproof, to ſuch formal Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, <hi>as are meerly for the teaching of the Word, without the inward teaching of the Spirit of God.</hi> When wee plead for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, wee ſay not the bare hearing of Sermons, and preſence at Prayers, will bring ſouls to Heaven. The way of dull formality, and outſide boaſting, Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hypocriſie, was never the way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to eternal ſalvation. 'Tis a ſmall commendation to be a good <hi>Church-man;</hi> and yet ſome praiſe it doth deſerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſpeaks them to be upon Gods ground, whilſt they are waiting upon the outward means. But to frequent Sermons on the Sabbath, and the Ale-houſe on the week-daies, is a Religion that pleaſes none better, than the Devil, and boon compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Such are but <hi>Religious Atheists,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious in their Profeſſion, and Atheiſts in their Practice. The Devil would never have raiſed perſecution againſt the Chriſtian Religion, if none that profeſſed it, would ever go further, then the bare outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Goſpel-duties. The Devil loves Hypocrites well, and therefore hath prepared them a principal ſeat in Hell. <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and unbeleevers</hi> are placed in the very fore-front of the damned crew.<note place="margin">Mat. 24.51</note>

Any buſineſs, that cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched on week-daies, or would hinder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work by the doing of it then, on the Sabbath they have time enough for it, though with the loſs of Publick Worſhip. They can be bold with God, to treſpaſs upon him in that way, that if others ſhould but treſpaſs ſo much upon them, in the like nature, they would endeavour to recover <hi>damages</hi> of them.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49488:126"/>of <hi>Conſolation</hi> to Gods Children. God is preſent to teach them by his Spirit, and is not this matter of very great comfort, to have ſuch a Teacher? and eſpecially, if wee conſider, that they are taught by him
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The beſt Leſſons.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>To walk in the beſt way.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They are taught the beſt Leſſons by the Spirit of God.</hi> Men indeed may propound the ſame Leſſons, but the Spirit of God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can effectually teach them. Theſe <hi>four</hi> Leſſons they are taught effectually.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Recte credere,</hi> to beleeve aright. 'Tis the work of God,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.29</note> that wee beleeve on him whom hee hath ſent. True Faith is fixed upon Chriſt, as hee was ſent by the Father, and not as hee is fancied to be by our corrupt minds, and this is a work of the Spirit in the ſoul. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">2 Theſ 3.2</note> 
                  <hi>All men have not Faith.</hi> Thoſe that have it are true Chriſtians, and do receive it as a ſpecial gift at Gods hands. <hi>By grace are yee ſaved, through Faith, and that not of your ſelves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.8</note> 
                  <hi>it is the gift of God.</hi> The Spirit works this Faith, by opening the eyes of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, convincing of the conſcience, of ſin in himſelf, and righteouſneſs in Chriſt, then the will is renewed, and made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49488:127"/>to accept of Chriſt, not onely out of ſafety, but out of delight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Recte vivere,</hi> to live aright. <hi>As many as are the Sons of God, are lead by the Spirit of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.14</note> It holds true thus, as that of the Apoſtle doth; <hi>As many as are lead by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God.</hi> Faith in a true Chriſtian is not a dead Faith. <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> As the Spirit helps Chriſtians to receive Chriſt by Faith, ſo hee helps them to live in Chriſt, and to Chriſt by new obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Recte diligere,</hi> to love aright. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.22</note> They that are taught of the Spirit of God, are taught, <hi>love,</hi> both to God and Men; they then love God for himſelf, and Men for Gods ſake. 'Tis <hi>Love,</hi> not envy, not malice, not reviling, not hatred, not backbiting and ſlandering others that are not juſt of our opinion; that is the fruit of the Spirit of God. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love teacheth men to be conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and not to be cenſorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, Recte orare,</hi> to pray aright. With what face can any pretend the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit, and either neglect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the uſe of prayer: When as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſet out in Scripture by this Title.<note place="margin">Zach 12.10</note> 
                  <hi>The Spirit of Supplication.</hi> And in that known
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49488:127"/>place.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26</note> 
                  <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities, and teacheth us to pray.</hi> The grace of prayer is one of the ſweeteſt flowers that grows in a Chriſtians Garden, and ſo very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and cordial.</p>
               <p>§ 14. 2. <hi>They are taught to walk in the beſt way.</hi> Some run on in a way of carnal pleaſures, others are taken up meerly with Ceremonies of Worſhip, with a neglect of ſanctity; others in a way of ſeparation and error, but a Childe of God, guided by the Spirit, walks on in the way of <hi>Holineſs and Peace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.14</note> They are taught <hi>to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.3</note> They that are not men of Peace, and Truth, in Gods Church, are not men of God. They are Fire-brands of Hell, that are alwaies kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the flames of contention, and diviſion in the Church of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They are taught to aim at the beſt end, viz.</hi> Gods glory, and their own ſalvation. Carnal minds have carnal ends. A mans aims, diſcover much a mans temper. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous men aim at pleaſure, ambitious men at honour, covetous men at gain and profit, &amp;c. But a Saint of God makes Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Happineſs, and the things of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity his aim, and his main deſign. Theſe are ſpiritual ends, and ſo ſpeak the man
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49488:128"/>to be ſpiritual. Now then to cloſe all, thoſe that are thus taught of the Spirit of God, <hi>The beſt Leſſons, to walk in the beſt way, and to aim at the beſt ends;</hi> muſt needs have more comfort than thoſe carnal wretches, who live in <hi>ignorance,</hi> walk in <hi>errour,</hi> and whoſe end is eternal <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
